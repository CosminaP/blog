# Logotherapy - The meaning-centered Psychotherapy

Logotherapy was developed by neurologist and psychiatrist [Viktor Frankl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Frankl) and it is founded upon the belief that striving to find meaning in life is the primary, most powerful motivating and driving force in Humans. A short introduction to this system is given in Frankl's most famous book, [Man's Search for Meaning](https://www.amazon.com/Mans-Search-Meaning-Viktor-Frankl-ebook/dp/B009U9S6FI), in which he outlines how his theories helped him to survive his Holocaust experience and how that experience further developed and reinforced his theories.

The notion of Logotherapy was created with the Greek word logos (“meaning” ) and focuses on the meaning of human existence as well as on man’s search for such a meaning. Victor Frankl’s concept is based on the premise that the primary motivational force of an individual is to find a meaning in life. 

The following list of tenets represents basic principles of logotherapy:  
 1. Life has meaning under all circumstances, even the most miserable ones. 
 2. Our main motivation for living is our will to find meaning in life. 
 3. We have freedom to find meaning in what we do, and what we experience, or at least in the stance we take when faced with a situation of unchangeable suffering.

According to logotherapy, this striving to find a meaning in one’s life is the primary motivational force in man. 
Man’s search for meaning is the primary motivation in his life and not a “secondary rationalization” of instinctual drives.This meaning is unique and specific in that it must and can be fulfilled by him alone; only then does it achieve a significance which will satisfy his own will to meaning. 

Man’s will to meaning can also be frustrated, in which case logotherapy speaks of “existential frustration.” 
The term “existential” may be used in three ways: to refer to 
  1. Existence itself, i.e., the specifically human mode of being; 
  2. The meaning of existence; 
  3. The striving to find a concrete meaning in personal existence, that is to say, the will to meaning.

Existential frustration can also result in neuroses. For this type of neuroses, logotherapy has coined the term [“noögenic neuroses”] 
[Noögenic neuroses] have their origin not in the psychological but rather in the “noological” (from the Greek noös meaning mind) dimension of human existence. This is another logotherapeutic term which denotes anything pertaining to the specifically human dimension.

#### NOÖGENIC NEUROSES

Noögenic neuroses emerge from existential problems. Among such problems, the frustration of the will to meaning plays a large role.
Existential frustration is in itself neither pathological nor pathogenic. A man’s concern, even his despair, over the worthwhileness of life is an existential distress but by no means a mental disease. It is doctor's task, to pilot the patient through his existential crises of growth and development. Logotherapy regards its doctor's assignment to assist the patient in finding meaning in his life. Inasmuch as logotherapy makes him aware of the hidden logos of his existence, it is an analytical process. To this extent, logotherapy resembles psychoanalysis. However, in logotherapy existential realities are primal, such as the potential meaning of patient existence to be fulfilled as well as his will to meaning. 

#### NOÖ-DYNAMICS

Man’s search for meaning should arouse inner tension rather than inner equilibrium. Such tension is an indispensable prerequisite of mental health. There is nothing in the world, that would so effectively help one to survive even the worst conditions as the knowledge that there is a meaning in one’s life. There is much wisdom in the words of Nietzsche: _“He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.”_. 

Thus it can be seen that mental health is based on a certain degree of tension, the tension between what one has already achieved and what one still ought to accomplish, or the gap between what one is and what one should become. Such a tension is inherent in the human being and therefore is indispensable to mental well-being. We should not, then, be hesitant about challenging man with a potential meaning for him to fulfill. 

What man actually needs is not a tensionless state but rather the striving and struggling for a worthwhile goal, a freely chosen task. What he needs is not the discharge of tension at any cost but the call of a potential meaning waiting to be fulfilled by him. What man needs is “noö-dynamics”, the existential dynamics in a polar field of tension where one pole is represented by a meaning that is to be fulfilled and the other pole by the man who has to fulfill it.

There is a detrimental influence of that feeling of which so many patients complain today, namely, the feeling of the total and ultimate meaninglessness of their lives. They lack the awareness of a meaning worth living for. They are haunted by the experience of their inner emptiness, a void within themselves; they are caught in that situation called the [“existential vacuum”].

#### THE EXISTENTIAL VACUUM
The existential vacuum is a widespread phenomenon of the twentieth century. This is understandable; it may be due to a twofold loss which man has had to undergo since he became a truly human being. No instinct tells man what he has to do, and no tradition tells him what he ought to do; sometimes he does not even know what he wishes to do. Instead, he either wishes to do what other people do [(conformism)] or he does what other people wish him to do [(totalitarianism)].
The existential vacuum manifests itself mainly in a state of boredom. In actual fact, boredom is now causing, more problems to solve than distress. And these problems are growing increasingly crucial, for progressive automation will probably lead to an enormous increase in the leisure hours available to the average worker. The pity of it is that many of these will not know what to do with all their newly acquired free time. 

Let us consider, for instance, [“Sunday neurosis”], that kind of depression which afflicts people who become aware of the lack of content in their lives when the rush of the busy week is over and the void within themselves becomes manifest. Not a few cases of suicide can be traced back to this existential vacuum. Such widespread phenomena as depression, aggression and addiction are not understandable unless we recognize the [existential vacuum] underlying them. This is also true of the crises of pensioners and aging people. Moreover, there are various masks and guises under which the existential vacuum appears. Sometimes the frustrated will to meaning is vicariously compensated for by a will to power, including the most primitive form of the will to power, the will to money. In other cases, the place of frustrated will to meaning is taken by the will to pleasure. That is why existential frustration often eventuates in sexual compensation. We can observe in such cases that the sexual libido becomes rampant in the existential vacuum.

Therefore, logotherapy is indicated not only in noögenic cases, as pointed out above, but also in psychogenic cases, and sometimes even the somatogenic (pseudo-) neuroses. Let us now consider what we can do if a patient asks what the meaning of his life is.

#### THE MEANING OF LIFE
I doubt whether a doctor can answer this question in general terms. For the meaning of life differs from man to man, from day to day and from hour to hour. What matters, therefore, is not the meaning of life in general but rather the specific meaning of a person’s life at a given moment.

Therefore one should not search for an abstract meaning of life. Everyone has his own specific vocation or mission in life to carry out a concrete assignment which demands fulfillment. Therein he cannot be replaced, nor can his life be repeated. Thus, everyone’s task is as unique as is his specific opportunity to implement it.

Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather he must recognize that it is he who is asked. In a word, each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible. Thus, logotherapy sees in responsibleness the very essence of human existence.

#### THE ESSENCE OF EXISTENCE
> _Live as if you were living already for the second time and as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now!_

There is nothing which would stimulate a man’s sense of responsibleness more than the maxim above, which invites man to imagine first that the present is past and, second, that the past may yet be changed and amended. Such a precept confronts him with life’s finiteness as well as the finality of what he makes out of both his life and himself.

Logotherapy tries to make the man fully aware of his own responsibleness; therefore, he has the option for what, to what, or to whom he understands himself to be responsible. 

That is why a logotherapist is the least tempted of all psychotherapists to impose value judgments on his patients, for he will never permit the patient to pass to the doctor the responsibility of judging. Logotherapy is neither teaching nor preaching. The role played by a logotherapist is that of an eye specialist rather than that of a painter. A painter tries to convey to us a picture of the world as he sees it; an ophthalmologist tries to enable us to see the world as it really is. The logotherapist’s role consists of widening and broadening the visual field of the patient so that the whole spectrum of potential meaning becomes conscious and visible to him.

Thus far the meaning of life always changes, but that it never ceases to be. According to logotherapy, we can discover this meaning in life in three different ways: 

> (1) by creating a work or doing a deed; 

> (2) by experiencing something or encountering someone — such as goodness, truth and beauty—by experiencing nature;

> (3) by the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering. 
 
#### THE MEANING OF LOVE
Love is the only way to grasp another human being in the innermost core of his personality. No one can become fully aware of the very essence of another human being unless he loves him.  By his love he is enabled to see the essential traits and features in the beloved person; and even more, he sees that which is potential in him, which is not yet actualized but yet ought to be actualized. Furthermore, by his love, the loving person enables the beloved person to actualize these potentialities. By making him aware of what he can be and of what he should become, he makes these potentialities come true.
In logotherapy, love is as primary a phenomenon as sex. Normally, sex is a mode of expression for love. Sex is justified, even sanctified, as soon as, but only as long as, it is a vehicle of love. Thus love is not understood as a mere side-effect of sex; rather, sex is a way of expressing the experience of that ultimate togetherness which is called love.
The third way of finding a meaning in life is by suffering.

#### THE MEANING OF SUFFERING
We must never forget that we may also find meaning in life even when confronted with a hopeless situation, when facing a fate that cannot be changed. For what then matters is to bear witness to the uniquely human potential at its best, which is to transform a personal tragedy into a triumph, to turn one’s predicament into a human achievement. 
But let me make it perfectly clear that in no way is suffering necessary to find meaning. I only insist that meaning is possible even in spite of suffering—provided or unavoidable suffering situations. To suffer unnecessarily is masochistic rather than heroic.

#### META-CLINICAL QUESTIONS

And what about man? Are you sure that the human world is a terminal point in the evolution of the cosmos? Is it not conceivable that there is still another dimension, a world beyond man’s world; a world in which the question of an ultimate meaning of human suffering would find an answer?

#### LIFE’S TRANSITORINESS 

Logotherapy is not pessimistic but rather activistic. To express this point figuratively we might say: The pessimist resembles a man who observes with fear and sadness that his wall calendar, from which he daily tears a sheet, grows thinner with each passing day. On the other hand, the person who attacks the problems of life actively is like a man who removes each successive leaf from his calendar and files it neatly and carefully away with its predecessors, after first having jotted down a few diary notes on the back. He can reflect with pride and joy on all the richness set down in these notes, on all the life he has already lived to the fullest. What will it matter to him if he notices that he is growing old? Has he any reason to envy the young people whom he sees, or wax nostalgic over his own lost youth? What reasons has he to envy a young person? For the possibilities that a young person has, the future which is in store for him? “No, thank you,” he will think. “Instead of possibilities, I have realities in my past, the reality of work done and of love loved since these are things which cannot inspire envy.”

#### LOGOTHERAPY AS A TECHNIQUE

A realistic fear, like the fear of death, cannot be tranquilized away by its psychodynamic interpretation; on the other hand, a neurotic fear, such as agoraphobia, cannot be cured by philosophical understanding. However, logotherapy has developed a special technique to handle such cases, too. To understand what is going on whenever this technique is used, we take as a starting point a condition which is frequently observed in neurotic individuals, namely, anticipatory anxiety. It is characteristic of this fear that it produces precisely that of which the patient is afraid. An individual, for example, who is afraid of blushing when he enters a large room and faces many people will actually be more prone to blush under these circumstances. 

Ironically enough, in the same way that fear brings to pass what one is afraid of, likewise a forced intention makes impossible what one forcibly wishes. This is the case of excessive intention, or **“hyper-intention”**. 
In addition to excessive intention as described above, excessive attention, or **“hyper-reflection”**, it is also be pathogenic (that is, lead to sickness). The following clinical report will indicate what I mean: A young woman came to me complaining of being frigid. The case history showed that in her childhood she had been sexually abused. However, it had not been this traumatic experience in itself which had eventuated in her sexual neurosis, as could easily be evidenced. For it turned out that, through reading popular psychoanalytic literature, the patient had lived constantly with the fearful expectation of the toll which her traumatic experience would someday take. This anticipatory anxiety resulted both in excessive intention to confirm her femininity and excessive attention centered upon herself rather than upon her partner. This was enough to incapacitate the patient for the peak experience of  sexual pleasure, since the orgasm was made an object of intention, and an object of attention as well, instead of remaining an unintended effect of unreflected dedication and surrender to the partner. After undergoing short-term logotherapy, the patient’s excessive attention and intention of her ability to experience orgasm had been “dereflected”. When her attention was refocused toward the proper object, i.e., the partner, orgasm established itself spontaneously.

Logotherapy bases its technique called **“paradoxical intention”** on the twofold fact that **fear brings about that which one is afraid of**, and that hyper-intention makes impossible what one wishes. Let me recall a case. A young physician consulted me because of his fear of perspiring. Whenever he expected an outbreak of perspiration, this anticipatory anxiety was enough to precipitate excessive sweating. In order to cut this circle formation I advised the patient, in the event that sweating should recur, to resolve deliberately to show people how much he could sweat. A week later he returned to report that whenever he met anyone who triggered his anticipatory anxiety, he said to himself, “I only sweated out a quart before, but now I’m going to pour at least ten quarts!” The result was that, after suffering from his phobia for four years, he was able, after a single session, to free himself permanently of it within one week.
This procedure consists of a reversal of the patient’s attitude, inasmuch as his fear is replaced by a paradoxical wish. By this treatment, the wind is taken out of the sails of the anxiety.

Such a procedure, however, must make use of the specifically human capacity for self-detachment inherent in a sense of humor. This basic capacity to detach one from oneself is actualized whenever the logotherapeutic technique called paradoxical intention is applied. At the same time, the patient is enabled to put himself at a distance from his own neurosis. 
 
 _“The neurotic who learns to laugh at himself may be on the way to self-management, perhaps to cure.”_
 
_Paradoxical intention_ can also be applied in cases of sleep disturbance. The fear of sleeplessness results in a hyper-intention to fall asleep, which, in turn, incapacitates the patient to do so. To overcome this particular fear, advise the patient not to try to sleep but rather to try to do just the opposite, that is, to stay awake as long as possible. In other words, the _hyper-intention_ to fall asleep, arising from the anticipatory anxiety of not being able to do so, must be replaced by the paradoxical intention not to fall asleep, which soon will be followed by sleep.

A given symptom is responded to by a phobia, the phobia triggers the symptom, and the symptom, in turn, reinforces the phobia. A similar chain of events, however, can be observed in obsessive-compulsive cases in which the patient fights the ideas which haunt him. Thereby, however, he increases their power to disturb him, since pressure precipitates counterpressure. Again the symptom is reinforced! On the other hand, as soon as the patient stops fighting his obsessions and instead tries to ridicule them by dealing with them in an ironical way—by applying paradoxical intention — the vicious circle is cut, the symptom diminishes and finally atrophies. 

As we see, anticipatory anxiety has to be counteracted by paradoxical intention; hyper-intention as well as hyper-reflection have to be counteracted by dereflection; dereflection, however, ultimately is not possible except by the patient’s orientation toward his specific vocation and mission in life; the cue to cure is self-transcendence!

#### THE COLLECTIVE NEUROSIS

Every age has its own collective neurosis, and every age needs its own psychotherapy to cope with it. The existential vacuum which is the mass neurosis of the present time can be described as a private and personal form of nihilism; for nihilism can be defined as the lack of meaning. Psychotherapy would not only reflect a nihilistic philosophy but also, even though unwillingly and unwittingly, transmit to the patient what is actually a caricature rather than a true picture of man.
First of all, there is a danger inherent in the teaching of man’s “nothingbutness,” the theory that man is nothing but the result of biological, psychological and sociological conditions, or the product of heredity and environment. Such a view of man makes a neurotic believe what he is prone to believe anyway, namely, that he is the pawn and victim of outer influences or inner circumstances. This neurotic fatalism is fostered and strengthened by a psychotherapy which denies that man is free.
A human being is NOT a finite thing, and his freedom is NOT restricted. You HAVE the freedom to take a stand toward the conditions.

#### CRITIQUE OF PAN-DETERMINISM

“Pan-determinism” - is an erroneous and dangerous assumptiond which disregards man's capacity to take a stand toward any conditions whatsoever. Keep in mind that man is the one who determines himself whether he gives in to conditions or stands up to them. In other words, man is ultimately self-determining. Man does not simply exist but always decides what his existence will be, what he will become in the next moment.

By the same token, every human being has the freedom to change at any instant. One of the main features of human existence is the capacity to rise above any kind of conditions, to grow beyond them. Man is capable of changing the world for the better if possible, and of changing himself for the better if necessary.

How can we dare to predict the behavior of man? We may predict the movements of a machine, of an automaton; more than this, we may even try to predict the mechanisms or “dynamisms” of the human psyche as well. But man is more than psyche. **Freedom is responsibleness**. In fact, freedom is in danger of degenerating into mere arbitrariness unless it is lived in terms of responsibleness. 


#### THE PSYCHIATRIC CREDO and PSYCHIATRY REHUMANIZED

_THE PSYCHIATRIC CREDO_ refers to the state of an incurably psychotic individual who might had lose his usefulness but yet retain the dignity of a human being. Without it I should not think it worthwhile to be a psychiatrist. For whose sake? Just for the sake of a damaged brain machine which cannot be repaired? 

For too long a time—for half a century, in fact—psychiatry tried to interpret the human mind merely as a mechanism, and consequently the therapy of mental disease merely in terms of a technique. 
A doctor, however, who would still interpret his own role mainly as that of a technician would confess that he sees in his patient nothing more than a machine, instead of seeing the human being behind the disease!
A human being is not one thing among others; things determine each other, but man is ultimately self-determining. 

> _**What a man becomes, is within the limits of endowment and environment that he has made out of himself.**_ 

Man has both potentialities within himself(good and bad); which one is actualized depends on decisions but not on conditions.
Our generation is realistic, for we have come to know man as he really is. After all, man is that being who invented the gas chambers of Auschwitz; however, he is also that being who entered those gas chambers upright, with the Lord’s Prayer or the Shema Yisrael on his lips.


#### The Case for a Tragic Optimism

LET US FIRST ask ourselves what should be understood by “a tragic optimism.” 
The meaning of TRAGIC OPTIMISM is that a man remains optimistic in spite of any “tragic triad”,  a triad which consists of those aspects of human existence which may be circumscribed by:
>   - (1) pain;

>   - (2) guilt;

>   - (3) death. 

__How is it possible to say yes to life in spite of all that?__ 
Can life retain its potential meaning in spite of its tragic aspects? After all, “saying yes to life in spite of everything”, presupposes that life is potentially meaningful under any conditions, even those which are most miserable. 
The idea is to turn life’s negative aspects into something _positive_ or _constructive_. In other words, what matters is to make the best of any given situation. **“The best”** of a given tragic situation is:  

>  (1) turning suffering into a human achievement and accomplishment; 

>  (2) deriving from guilt the opportunity to change oneself for the better; 

>  (3) deriving from life’s transitoriness an incentive to take responsible actions;

It must be kept in mind, however, that optimism is not anything to be commanded or ordered. One cannot even force oneself to be optimistic, against all odds, against all hope. And what is true for hope is also true for the other two components of the triad that faith and love cannot be commanded or ordered either.

To the European, it is a characteristic of the American culture that, again and again, one is commanded and ordered to “be happy.” But happiness cannot be pursued; it must ensue. One must have a reason to “be happy.” Once the reason is found, however, one becomes happy automatically. Thus Human being is not one in pursuit of happiness but rather in search of a reason to become happy.

If you want anyone to laugh you have to provide him with a reason, e.g., you have to tell him a joke. In no way is it possible to evoke real laughter by urging him, or having him urge himself, to laugh. Doing so would be the same as urging people posed in front of a camera to say “cheese,” only to find that in the finished photographs their faces are frozen in artificial smiles. Once an individual’s search for a meaning is successful, it not only renders him happy but also gives him the capability to cope with suffering. 

I think of those youngsters who, on a worldwide scale, refer to themselves as the “no future” generation. To be sure, it is not just a cigarette to which they resort; it is drugs. In fact, the drug scene is one aspect of a more general mass phenomenon, namely the feeling of meaninglessness resulting from a frustration of our existential needs which in turn has become a universal phenomenon in our industrial societies. Today it is not only logotherapists who claim that the feeling of meaninglessness plays an ever increasing role in the etiology of neurosis. 

As to the causation of the feeling of meaninglessness, one may say, albeit in an oversimplifying vein, that people have enough to live by but nothing to live for; they have the means but no meaning. To be sure, some do not even have the means. In particular, I think of the mass of people who are today unemployed and which they are prone to a specific type of depression **Unemployment Neurosis**. 

**What is Unemployment Neurosis?** 
  - Is a type of neurosis which originates as a result of a twofold erroneous identification: (1)being jobless equated with being useless, and (2) being useless equated with having a meaningless life.
  -  Main trigger for this type of neurosis is triggered by an individual’s socioeconomic situation. 

Consequently, in this caseses patients should either volunteer in youth organizations, adult education, public libraries or absord themselves in meanigful self study activities.  As soon as they fill their abundant free time with some sort of unpaid but meaningful activity—their depression disappeare even if their economic situation does not change and their hunger is the same. The truth is that man does not live by welfare alone.

Just consider the mass neurotic syndrome so pervasive in the young generation: there is ample empirical evidence that the three facets of this syndrome—depression: 
   1. Aggression
   2. Addiction — are due to what is called in logotherapy “the existential vacuum,” 
   3. Feeling of Emptiness and Meaninglessness.

Doesn’t the final meaning of life, too, reveal itself, if at all, only at its end, on the verge of death? And doesn’t this final meaning, too, depend on whether or not the potential meaning of each single situation has been actualized to the best of the respective individual’s knowledge and belief?

The fact remains that meaning, and its perception, as seen from the logotherapeutic angle, is completely down to earth rather than afloat in the air or resident in an ivory tower. Logotherapy conceives of conscience as a prompter which, if need be, indicates the direction in which we have to move in a given life situation. 

#### How does a man can findin his meaning in life? 
> All we can do is study the lives of people who seem to have found their answers to the questions of what ultimately life is about.

There are three main avenues on which one can fing a meaning in life: 

> (1) The first is by creating a work or by doing a deed. 

> (2) The second is by experiencing something; in other words, meaning can be found not only in work but also in love. 

> (3) The third avenue to meaning in life: even the helpless victim of a hopeless situation, facing a fate he cannot change, may rise above himself, may grow beyond himself, and by doing do he changes himself, by turning a personal tragedy into a triumph. One cannot change a situation that causes his suffering but he can ultiamtely choose his attitude.

> _Live as if you were living for the second time and had acted as wrongly the first time as you are about to act now_.

In fact, the opportunities to act properly, the potentialities to fulfill a meaning, are affected by the irreversibility of our lives.
For as soon as we have used an opportunity and have actualized a potential meaning, we have done so once and for all. We have rescued it into the past wherein it has been safely delivered and deposited. In the past, nothing is irretrievably lost, but rather, on the contrary, everything is irrevocably stored and treasured. 

_To be sure, people tend to see only the stubble fields of transitoriness but overlook and forget the full granaries of the past into which they have brought the harvest of their lives: the deeds done, the loves loved, and the sufferings they have gone through with courage and dignity._

From this one may see that there is no reason to pity old people. Instead, young people should envy them. It is true that the old have no opportunities, no possibilities in the future. But they have more than that. Instead of possibilities in the future, they have realities in the past—the potentialities they have actualized, the meanings they have fulfilled, the values they have realized—and nothing and nobody can ever remove these assets from the past.

Just as life remains potentially meaningful under any conditions, even those which are most miserable, so too does the value of each and every person stay with him or her, and it does so because it is based on the values that he or she has realized in the past, and is not contingent on the usefulness that he or she may or may not retain in the present.
More specifically, this usefulness is usually defined in terms of functioning for the benefit of society. But today’s society is characterized by achievement orientation, and consequently it adores people who are successful and happy and, in particular, it adores the young. It virtually ignores the value of all those who are otherwise, and in so doing blurs the decisive difference between being valuable in the sense of dignity and being valuable in the sense of usefulness. If one is not cognizant of this difference and holds that an individual’s value stems only from his present 

Decent people form a minority. More than that, they always will remain a minority. Thus it is a very challenge to join the minority. For the world is in a bad state, but everything will become still worse unless each of us does his best.

**So, let us be alert—alert in a twofold sense:**

> _Since Auschwitz we know what man is capable of._

> _And since Hiroshima we know what is at stake._
