## Women's Strength Training Anatomy
Part reference, part exercise, this books is a manual with helpful hints and facts. It includes beautiful drawings to guide you how to exercise your muscles and in which order. Overall this is a complete manual for someone looking to get health benefits and enhance their appearance as well.

## PART 1 - 20 Steps to Creating a Personalized Program

## STEP 1 - Identify Your Goals
To create a perfectly tailored weight training program that suits your needs, you must first clearly define your objectives:
  - Reshape your body
  - Get rid of excess body fat
  - Improve your sport performance
  - Remain healthy
  - Fight the loss of mobility due to aging

## STEP 2 - Decide How Many Days Per Week to Train
For the various schedules, here are the options:
  - One weekly weight training session: This schedule does not pose any recovery issues, and weight training can be done on any day.
  - Two weekly weight training sessions: Separate workouts as much as possible (e.g., Monday and Thursday or Tuesday and Friday), but at a minimum, try to respect the pattern of one workout and one day of rest. 
  - Three weekly weight training sessions: With this schedule, respecting the one-workout-one-day-of-rest pattern is difficult, but still possible. Try to balance your week as much as possible—for example, by weight training on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday or on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.
 - Four weekly weight training sessions: With such a high training frequency, properly spacing the workouts to provide your body with enough rest is difficult. Whenever you perform two workouts without rest between them, make sure that one targets your upper body and the other targets your lower body.
## STEP 3 - Choose Your Training Days
To progress quickly, follow this one main rule: One day of weight training has to be followed by at least one day of rest from weight training (so doing a cardio workout the day after a weight training session is a possibility). Cardio training has fewer constraints because it does not traumatize the body nearly as much as weight training does. 
## STEP 4 - Decide Whether to Train More Than Once Per Day
We strongly advise not to weight train twice a day. Ideally, cardio can be performed on days you do not weight train. But it is conceivable to do cardio in the morning and weight training later in the day. Alternatively, you can weight train in the morning and do cardio at night. 
## STEP 5 - Choose Your Training Time
Is it better to train in the morning, at noon, in the afternoon, or in the evening?
ANSWER: Scientific studies have shown that muscle strength and endurance vary throughout the day. Most women are stronger in the afternoon and weaker in the morning. The body is a little bit colder in the morning, and it slowly warms up with time and as a result of eating. This slight elevation in temperature is associated with an increase in central nervous system efficiency. Therefore, muscle power rises in parallel with body temperature. Training whenever your muscles are at their strongest is ideal, which for most woman this peak performance occurs in the afternoon.
## STEP 6 - Choose an Order in Which to Work the Muscles in Each Session
Training your whole body in one workout would be cumbersome. There are six major body regions which must be trainned:
1. Legs (quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and calves)
2. Abdomen
3. Back
4. Chest
5. Arms (biceps and triceps)
6. Shoulders

The following four tips can help you design your program:
1. Take full advantage of the indirect work.
Always train your arms before your back or chest. This results in the biceps or triceps being too tired to handle the weight necessary to stimulate the chest and the back. The same goes for your legs. Training your calves first will tire them and decrease
your strength for the basic leg exercises. Furthermore, the quadriceps and hamstring exercises provide enough indirect calf stimulation to render direct lower-leg exercises superfluous in many cases.
2. Rate the importance of each muscle according to your goals.
If you want chiseled abdominal muscles, you can begin each workout with abdominal exercises as a warm-up.
3. Focus on your weak areas.
4. Use the rotation principle.
## STEP 7 - Schedule Your Body Regions for Each Workout
If you want to make quick progress in strength and body shaping, the best thing to do is to work each muscle group twice a week.
> Four Weekly Weight Training Workouts:
#### Workout 1
 - **Lower body**: quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes
 - **Upper body**: abdomen
#### Workout 2
 - **Upper body**: abdomen, shoulders, and back
 - **Lower body**: glutes
#### Workout 3
 - **Lower body**: glutes, hamstrings, and quadriceps
 - **Upper body**: abdomen
#### Workout 4
 - **Upper body**: abdomen, chest, and arms
 - **Lower body**: hamstrings
## STEP 8 - Determine How Many Exercises to do Per Body Region
## STEP 9 -Choose the Number of Sets Per Muscle Group
For aesthetic purposes, muscles can artificially be divided into the following
three major categories:
1. Most important muscles: quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes
2. Complex muscles: back, shoulders, and abdominals
3. Less important muscles: chest, biceps, triceps, forearms, and calves
Beginners should aim for the following totals:
 - Two or three sets for each of the most important muscles
 - One or two sets for each of the complex muscles
 - One set for each of the less important muscles
After a couple months of training, you should aim for the following:
 - Three or four sets for each of the most important muscles 
 - Two or three sets for each of the complex muscles
 - One or two sets for each of the less important muscles
After six months of training, you should aim for the following totals:
 - Four or five sets for each of the most important muscles
 - Three or four sets for each of the complex muscles
 - One to three sets for each of the less important muscles
 
## STEP 10 - Choose the Number of Repetitions Per Set
How many times (repetitions) should you perform an exercise in each set? 
- For muscle toning, it is best to do from 10 to 20 repetitions with heavier weights. 
- To burn calories and fat and to improve your cardiovascular health, do at least 30 repetitions, and up to 50, with lighter weights.
##### Use the three set rule: 
   - Once your muscles are fully warmed up, start with a light weight and a high number of repetitions (e.g., 20) for the first set.        - For the second set increase the weight enough so that you can perform only 12 to 15 repetitions.
   - For the third set, add weight so that you can perform only 10 repetitions.
## STEP 11 - Decide How Long Your Workout Should Last
How much time should you devote to each workout? 
 - This issue is very important not only to get fast results but also, and more important, to be able to stick to your program. You do not want to use too long a workout as an excuse not to go to the gym. A brief workout is much better than no workout at all.
 - The objective of a good workout is to stimulate muscles to their maximum in the shortest time possible. What you should look for are strategies that increase a workout’s intensity rather than its length.
A good weight training workout lasts at least 30 minutes and up to a maximum of 45 minutes. If you spend more than one hour working out, your effort is not intense enough. At the end of 30 to 45 minutes, your muscles should be begging for mercy.
The duration of your workout depends on two things:
1. Volume of work (number of exercises plus number of sets)
2. Rest time between sets

Do not weight train for more than an hour because this means that you are doing one, or a combination, of the following:
 - Working too many muscles per session
 - Doing too many exercises
 - Doing too many sets
 - Taking too much rest time between sets
## STEP 12 - Learn the Proper Speed for Each Repetition
The speed of your repetitions is a very important factor in the success of your program. Do not lift a weight with too much speed by using momentum and body swings instead of your own muscle strength. If you are just starting weight lifting, use a deliberate tempo rather than an explosive motion. You will quickly realize that a slower motion is more excruciating than a fast one. You use your muscles much more when you lift a weight up and down slowly, which is exactly what you want.
We recommend that you take two or three seconds to raise a weight and atleast as much time, if not slightly more, to lower it. The weaker your muscles are, the slower each repetition should be performed. Raise the weight in five seconds and lower it in three to five seconds. 
## STEP 13 -Determine How Long to Rest Between Sets
Consider your rest time between sets as a tool to help you reach your goal faster. If you mainly wish to sculpt your muscles, you need to rest long enough so that you recover most of your strength. On the other hand, you do not want to rest so much that your workout loses its intensity despite the heavier weight. If your goal is mainly to burn fat, do not rest much. Following are good between-set resting guidelines:
 - To tone up, 30 to 45 seconds of rest should suffice. 
 - To burn calories and fat, you should adopt a faster pace with only 10 to 20 seconds of rest between sets. As you progress, reduce this resting time to a bare minimum. 
Research has shown that women performing a similar workload as men produce less lactic acid and experience a lower elevation of heart rate. Therefore, we require less rest than men do between sets.
## STEP 14 - Avoid Rest Time Between Two Different Exercises
Avoid wasting time when changing exercises. The time required to move from one machine to the next and adjust the seat or the weight (or both) provides enough rest. You might even have to wait for someone to finish a set. Do not add this compulsory wait time to a voluntary rest you just took. Moving fast burns both more calories and more fat while cutting down on the time you spend in the gym.
## STEP 15 - Pick the Proper Weight for Each Exercise
Start with a resistance that seems too light to be challenging for your muscles. This easy set will serve as a first warm-up.
For your real first working set, increase the resistance even more. For your second working set, you might increase the resistance slightly more to render the movement more challenging. It is very helpful to note each of your weights as well as the number of repetitions you performed for each exercise in a notebook or in your phone. There are plenty of apps for this.
## STEP 16 - Know When to Increase Resistance
If you scrupulously note all your workouts as suggested, you will easily figure outwhen to increase your weight for your next workout. If you do not write down your weight, you will face a very tedious task.
#### As a rule of thumb:
 - If you performed more repetitions than expected for an exercise in your last workout, pick up a slightly heavier weight today.
 - If you perform fewer repetitions than expected for an exercise in your last workout, use the same amount of resistance until you feel very comfortable with that weight.
## STEP 17 - Choose Exercises That Suit Your Morphology
Everybody's morphology is unique in terms of height and the length of torso, legs, and arms. Some exercises force us to adopt unnatural positions, whereas others feel very natural to us. If a movement places you in an uncomfortable position, eliminate it from your routine. When you start lifting, stick to movements that you feel your build is designed to perform safely. 
As a rule of thumb, the taller you are, the more dangerous the basic free weight exercises will be because you have to go through
a much greater range of motion. This is typically true of the squat and the chest press. By the same token, body weight exercises such as push-ups are likely to be more traumatic for your joints, also because of this greater range of motion.
#### Machines Versus Free Weights - Which is more effective?
The two main kinds of resistance in weight training are free weights (dumbbells and bar) and machines. Hamstrings, are difficult to train without machines. On the other hand, free weights are more appropriate for biceps. For this reason, a combination of both is best. It is a common belief in the gym that free weights are more effective than machines. This is simply not true. The most effective way to make progress is to use machines whenever they are more appropriate than free weights, and free weights whenever they are
more appropriate than machines. Beginner should use machines machines, because they are typically much easier to master and better guide your movement as you learn the exerciseMany new machines provide quick response (QR) codes that allow you to view a video of how to use the machine on your smartphone. You do not have to rely on anyone to demonstrate the proper use of the equipment. Of course,
there is no such QR code on free weights. Women starting weight lifting are more likely to make better progress with machines than with free weights. As you progress, you can move on to more complex, free weight exercises. They will be easier then because your muscles will have gotten used to the workout. Starting directly with free weight movement is more complicated because it involves motor learning that will slow down your gains of muscle strength.
#### There are Two Major Exercise Subcategories
All movements, can be divided into two major categories: 
 - basic and multiple-joint exercises;
 - isolated and single-joint exercises.
1. Basic, multiple-joint exercises: Whenever more than one joint is flexed, the exercise is classified as a basic, multiple-joint exercise. For example, in a leg lunge, the knees, ankles, and hips are mobilized. Basic movements are more demanding than isolated movements, and they save time in your workout by working multiple muscles, but they are more complex to master.
2. Isolated, single-joint exercises: Whenever only one joint is flexed, the exercise is classified as an isolated, single-joint exercise. For example, in the leg extension, only the knees are mobilized. Because of the lesser demand on the body, isolated movements are easier to perform than basic, multiple-joint ones. However, because they recruit fewer muscles groups, they are less effective in terms of strength gains and calorie expenditure. 
## STEP 18 - Recognize When It’s Time to Change Your Program
Maintain the same training program for as long as you are making gains on it. Once you are familiar with weight training, feel free to change your exercises as frequently as you wish because there are few learning curves as you introduce new movements.
## STEP 19 - Take a Break
If you go on a vacation or feel as though you need a break, it is fine to stop training for one or two weeks. But remember that when you stop working out, you do not burn as many calories; if you do not watch your diet, you might accumulate fat easily.
## STEP 20 - Maintain Your Gains
Maintaining muscle gain is easier than acquiring it. If strength increases rapidly as you first start training, its reduction occurs quickly if you stop working out for a while. Muscle shape is more resistant to a long rest period, which demonstrates that the reduction of strength is mainly due to a temporary weakening of the nervous signals. Your peak strength will return to its maximum within a couple weeks of training.

#### How do you increase the intesity of your trainning? 
- The most obvious are adding weight and increasing the number of repetitions. These techniques use the overload principle. Both are excellent ways to put more stress on the muscles, but they also place more tension on the joints and ligaments;

## Techniques to increase training intensity without traumatizing your joints:
##### Muscle Burn
As your set progresses, your muscles feel as if they are burning. As you perform more and more repetitions, the intensity of this burn amplifies. This painful sensation is caused by the accumulation of waste known as lactic acid that gets trapped in the working muscles. The muscle burn pain is a signal that you are pushing your muscles past what they are accustomed to. As a result, they have to become stronger and more resistant, which also translates into increased muscle definition. Because it makes you uncomfortable, lactic acid may seem like an enemy. One goal of weight training is to turn this obstacle around and transform it into an opportunity for progression. Your main concern should be to learn how to generate and tolerate as much muscle burn as possible. Trying to achieve more muscle burn
is a good alternative to handling heavier weight because it is safer on the joints

##### Continuous Tension
Maintaining continuous tension in the muscle throughout the repetitions is a good way to increase difficulty without increasing weight. This requires that you not relax your muscles at any time during the exercise.

##### Descending Sets
Using descending sets allows you to continue a set once you have reached fatigue without having to cheat. 
How does it works? - For example, imagine that you are performing some barbell curls with 30 pounds(13.6 kg). At failure, you remove 10 pounds (4.5 kg) and resume the curls for a few extra reps. If you wish to push your muscles extra hard, whenever you reachfailure again, strip down another 10 pounds (4.5 kg) and immediately start the exercise again. In general, you should not lighten the weights more than twice during a single set.

##### Supersets
A superset involves moving from one exercise to the next without taking any rest between movements. This technique allows you to work even more beyond failure than you can using descending sets. The two main forms are antagonistic supersets and supersets for the same muscles. 
 -  Antagonistic Supersets 
> Antagonistic supersets consist of doing an exercise for one muscle followed immediately by another exercise for the antagonistic  
> muscle. For example, you start with a quadriceps exercise such as the leg extension and follow it with a hamstring exercise such as  
> the leg curl. The goal here is to save time by not having to rest between sets. The muscles of the quadriceps recover while you train  > the hamstrings, and vice versa. 
> Examples of the main antagonistic supersets:
   - Crunch for the abs and hyperextension for the lower back
   - Incline press for the chest and machine pull-down for the back
   - Lateral raise for the shoulders and rowing for the back
   - Biceps curl and pulley triceps extension
Main BENEFITS: With antagonistic supersets, by moving quickly from one exercise to another, you shape your muscles while increasing their endurance and burning more calories and fat.
 -  Supersets for the Same Muscle
> A superset for the same muscle consists of doing an exercise for a muscle followed immediately by another exercise for the same 
> muscle. The goal is to increase the time under tension and muscle burn.
> You can choose your exercises for this type of superset based on one of the following rules:
     -  Postexhaustion exercises: Start with a basic, multiple-joint exercise. When you reach exhaustion, move on to an isolating exercise. For example, the squats alone may not induce an intense muscle burn in the glutes, but by moving to the ButtBlaster, your glutes will soon be on fire.
     -   Preexhaustion exercises: Start with an isolating exercise. When you reach exhaustion, move on to a basic, multiple-joint exercise. For example, start training your buttocks with a machine such as the Butt Blaster. At failure, go directly to the squat or the lunge. 
Main BENEFITS: With antagonistic supersets, by moving quickly from one exercise to another, you shape your muscles while increasing their endurance and burning more calories and fat.

## Tips and Tricks SECTION
###### Importance of the Warm-Up 
You can sustain an injury even while performing a very safe exercise if you do not warm up sufficiently. This is especially true as you get stronger. As you begin to be able to handle heavier weights, the warm-up becomes more and more critical. When you are not very strong, the joints and the tendons do not need much warming up because the muscular tension required is not significant. As you gain strength, you will need to increase your warm-up time, because you will be subjecting yourmuscles to tension that more and more closely approaches their point of rupture.

###### Training-Induced Headache
A training-induced headache is not, strictly speaking, an injury, but it is nonetheless a health discomfort related to physical exercise. The training-induced headache was first described by Hippocrates in 450 BC. Fortunately, it affects only a minority of women. As they start training, a mild to serious headache develops. This pain can last from a few minutes to a day and prevent them from training altogether. If you suffer from this condition, you should warm up very slowly and thoroughly to prevent it or at least postpone it. Avoid increasing the intensity immediately. Perform a few minutes of easy cardio to get your blood moving. Despite what is usually recommended, start your workout with a smaller body part and a light isolating exercise such as the shoulder lateral raise. Use compound movements such as squats or deadlifts at the very end of your workout because they are the most likely to trigger a headache if you are prone to it.

###### Stretching
Women’s tendons are already much more flexible than men’s are. This is one reason their joints are looser and more prone to injuries. If your joints are already unstable, stay away from stretching the muscles surrounding them. This is very common at the shoulder level. Strength training can tighten the shoulder joints so that they become more stable and less prone to injuries. However, don’t avoid
all stretching exercises just because you have an unstable shoulder. You can still stretch your hips, your lower back, your ankles, and other areas. Following a workout is the best time to stretch because a temporary reduction in muscle strength, if it occurs, will not be an issue. Ideally, you should stretch the muscles you have just worked because theywill be warm.

###### How to Stretch? 
  - Static stretching: Static stretching consists of holding the stretch position for 10 to 30 seconds. The degree of stretch has to be modulated according to your level of flexibility. If you are not flexible, do not stretch too much or for too long. As your flexibility improves, you can intensify the degree of stretching. 
  - Dynamic stretching: Dynamic stretching uses movement, often sportspecific movement, to achieve a stretch. Walking lunges, arm circles, and leg swings are examples of this type of stretch. 
  - Ballistic stretching: Ballistic stretching combines small bursts of stretching with small recoils of muscle contractions. You can repeat this combination of small, back and forth movements for 10 to 30 seconds.

##### Joint Laxity During Menstruation 
The risk of injury, especially of ligaments, is much greater in women than in men. For example, the incidence of tearing the cruciate ligaments of the knee is three times higher in female athletes than in their male counterparts. This vulnerability is largely due to a higher secretion of estrogen in women than in men. It is especially true during the preovulatory period. By the same token, hormonal fluctuations during this period cause increased flexibility in the muscles and tendons, suddenly rendering the joints less stable. Whenever you notice a sudden increase in joint laxity, stop stretching that joint. Also, reduce the amount of weight you are using on the exercises that mobilize that joint because the risk of injury has skyrocketed. Wait for stability to return to normal before resuming heavy training and stretching.

## Breakdown of Cardio Versus Weight Training
Weight training and cardio (aerobic) training are two very different forms of exercise. Yet, they are very complementary. Medical researchers have shown that cardio training favors fat loss, whereas resistance training enhances lean muscle mass as well as strength. Furthermore, aerobic activity is most appropriate for improving endurance and cardiovascular health.
The respective importance you should give to each form of training depends on your goals. Consider the following:
>  - If your priority is to lose body fat, you should mainly perform cardio training. However, do not neglect resistance training to preserve your lean mass. It is best to spend two thirds of your time performing cardio exercises and only one third performing weight training.
>  - If you mainly want to tone your body, devote two thirds of your time to weights and one third to cardio.
>  - If you desire to tone up and lose fat at the same time, divide your training time equally between weights and cardio.
>  - If you are too skinny, you can skip cardio as you attempt to gain as much muscle as possible.

#### Timing of Cardio Training
Following are times to perform cardio training:
  - First thing in the morning
  - At night, before bedtime
  - After and Before weight training
You can also perform half your cardio before weight training as a warm-up and the other half at the end of the workout as a cool-down. Researchers have shown that cardio training involving the legs before a lower-body workout temporarily reduces leg strength. This does not occur when cardio is performed before an upper-body training session. The timing of your cardio training will be mainly dictated by your daily schedule, but it can also depend on the effects you wish to produce in your body. Fatty acid release from the adipose tissues is not constant throughout the day. It follows a natural circadian pattern of being higher in the evening and in the morning after fasting overnight and lower during the day. It makes sense to perform cardio whenever the release of lipids is elevated, because doing so facilitates utilization and fat destruction. This means that cardio would be most beneficial when performed either in the evening or first thing in the morning. 

#### Timing of Eating With Cardio Training
Cardio can be performed in the morning on an empty stomach to use more fat as fuel because your body is running low on glycogen (energy) after a night of fasting. Studies have shown that performing cardio in a fasted state is the best way to reduce abnormally high triglycerides and cholesterol levels. On the other hand, cardio in a fasted state is not very effective for addressing glycemia. Our conclusion is that if you are prone to diabetes, it is best to do cardio after your last meal of the day. Our conclusion is that if you are prone to diabetes, it is best to do cardio after your last meal of the day. 

#### High-Intensity Versus Low-Intensity Cardio
Following are the two main forms of cardio training:
  - High-intensity cardio: The goal of high-intensity cardio is to run, cycle, or swim as fast as possible for around 20 minutes. The main advantage is that this burns a lot of calories in a minimal amount of time. Its main drawback is that while some of the
energy comes from fat, most of it is derived from reserves of carbohydrate (glycogen inside the muscle). This is an inefficient way of losing fat; the best way is to burn fat rather than carbohydrate.
  - Low-intensity cardio: The goal of low-intensity cardio is to run, cycle, or swim at a slower pace for at least 30 minutes. The main advantage is that it burns a lot of fat while sparing glycogen. Its main drawback is that it is more time-consuming because it burns fewer calories per minute.

#### Cardio Training Methods
In summary, running may be more beneficial than cycling to lose weight. However, running is much more traumatic for the knees, hips, and lower back. The treadmill is obviously less traumatic than classic running. Biomechanical studies have shown that to reduce the pressure on the knees and the hips, it is best to use slower, long strides rather than short, fast ones. A stair stepper is a great alternative to running, especially because it targets the glutes more than the treadmill does.

#### Keeping a Workout Notebook
It is important to keep a workout notebook so you can easily recall the number of repetitions you did for each exercise as well as the weight, or resistance, you used. Note the duration of your workouts as well. Time measurement is important because, if you rest longer between sets, your performance will improve, but it will not necessarily result in strength gains. To compare two workouts, you must
ensure that they are of approximately the same duration.
After each workout, examine your training session and ask yourself the following questions:
  - What worked well?
  - What did not work well? 
  - Why did it not work well?
  - How can I improve my next workout?

How can you determine whether you really used the proper form in each exercise? An easy way is to film yourself. If possible, do so from a different angle at each successive set. It can be very surprising to see yourself train because the fluidity of the movement is not always what you imagine. Using this feedback, you can immediately self-correct and thereby improve your form. High-level athletes
frequently use this strategy to enhance their techniques.

#  PART II - Exercises
### Now some of the must known Topics: 
 #### 1. How do you round your Glutes?
There are plenty of body weight exercises for toning the glutes. they work wonders at first, but their main limitation is the lack of resistance they provide. After a while, as your muscles get stronger, these exercises become too easy. You may perform more and more repetitions, but this is not the best way to get fast results. You have to overload the glutes with constantly heavier weights
to get them to respond. Because at first any repetition pattern provides results, it is best to remainbelow the 25-repetition range for toning. If you want rapid toning the best way to go is simply use the machines, beacuse they allow you to easily add resistance to really overload the glutes, which is the key to rapid results in muscle toning.
Now to understand how the Glutes work let's find out about the Anatomy and Morphology of the GLUTES. 
The glutes comprise three muscles:
  - **Gluteus Maximus**, which is by far the biggest of the three glute muscles. It is also the most visible.
  - **Gluteus Medius**, which is a small muscle that lies laterally above the gluteus maximus. It is visible from the side and the rear.
  - **Gluteus Minimus**, which is a small muscle that lies laterally below the gluteus maximus. therefore, it is not visible at all.
this section concentrates mainly on the gluteus maximus and a little on the gluteus medius.
![Glute Muscles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/muscles.png)

**How to effciently trigger your Glutes?** - When you walk slowly, they hardly work. But as soon as you accelerate and start running, the glutes are heavily recruited. So is time to put those trainning shoes on and start running 😏.

**How to improve your Glutes contour?** - Regular weight training will increase the size as well as the roundness and firmness of the glutes. It may also somewhat lift up the glutes, but this is far harder to achieve.
To visualize what you are trying to achieve, consider a woman’s overall posture and appearance while wearing high heels; specif cally, the lower back is slightly arched and the glutes are more visible. By weight training your glutes properly, you can achieve the same effect without the high heels.

  #### 2. Debunking Cellulite step by step
 
###### What is Cellulite and How it develops?
 - Development begins in adolescence, when girls start to release more and more female hormones. Both estrogen
and progesterone favor the growth of fat cells, particularly in the lower body. This fat proliferation impairs the microcirculation of blood in the lower body, which triggers localized inflammation. As a result of this blood flow restriction and inflammation, extra water is retained in the legs and bundles of collagen that give the skin its firmness become damaged. This looser skin explains theorange peel appearance of cellulite. Your genetic background also plays a major role in the localization of fat deposits around your glute area.

###### How can we get rid of Cellulite?
Is it possible to spot-reduce cellulite by specifically working the legs or the glutes? 
For a long time, medical studies were not able to prove that fat could be specifically eliminated in trouble spots by stimulating the underlying muscles. Increasing the adipose tissue blood ﬂ ow enhances the local release of fat, whereas reduced blood ﬂ ow inside a fat deposit promotes its growth. therefore, working a muscle group frequently not only prevents local fat hypertrophy but also favors the topical release of fat. consequently, it is important to frequently contract the muscles located under the fat deposit you want to
get rid of. 
***However, note that the magnitude of the local fat release is small. Therefore, you will not see results in weeks, but rather, in months, unless you follow a low-calorie diet. If you wish to develop __Leaner Legs__, you can do either cycling or running. We do not recommend swimming or rowing except for overall fat loss.***

**Glute exercises**
There are 4 main categories of Glutes exercises from which women can benefit:
  1. Hip Extension
  2. Bridge
  3. One-leg Butt Press
  4. Lateral Hip Abduction
  
**Note**: squats, lunges, and deadlifts are also excellent exercises for the glutes.

**Tips for efficient Glutes execises**: 
 - **Squeeze those Buttocks** - To better recruit the glutes while performing these exercises, squeeze your buttocks together tightly throughout the exercises.
 - **Warm Up the Glutes** - Always start with Warm up the Glutes by performing 20-30 easy repetitions of the following exercises using light weigths. Move from one exercise to the next without rest. If you do notfeel that one cycle was enough to warm you up, feel free to perform a second cycle.
 The exercises for warm up are one round of the above:
    - **Squats** -  perform 20 to 30 easy repetitions;
    - **Stiff-leg deadlift** - perform 20 to 30 easy repetitions;
    - **Calf raise** -  perform 20 to 30 easy repetitions;


## 1. Hip Extension
The hip extension belongs in the isolated, single-joint exercise category because only the hip joints are mobilized. Nevertheless, the hip extension recruits muscles in addition to the gluteus maximus: the hamstrings and the lower back. 

**How to Do It**
Starting with both feet together, lift one leg up as far back as possible using your Glutes. Hold the contracted position for one second while squeezing your buttocks together as tightly as possible. Return to the starting position and repeat. Once you have finished a set with one leg, move immediately to the other leg. To increase the range of motion, you can bring your leg forward until your thigh is about parallel with the ground and then straighten it to the back. The easiest way to perform the hip extension is standing because the range of motion is short and gravity results in little resistance being placed on the Gluteus Maximus.

![Hips](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/hips.png)
 
**Pros**
 - It is the easiest exercise to perform that directly targets the glute muscles.
 - It can be performed at home without much equipment.

**Cons**
 - Once you have gained more experience in weight training, you may want to move on to more complete leg exercises such as the squat or deadlift.

 **Tips**:
 - To really work the gluteus maximus, do not pivot your leg toward the outside too much. It is OK for the leg to move slightly toward the outside, but do not exaggerate this abduction of the leg.
 - Hip extension is limited by the iliofemoral ligament.
 - Free WeIghTS or MaChine? - machines render the movement more effective in terms of muscle toning by adding extra resistance, thereby increasing the difficulty of the movement.
 
###### There are 4 tipes of Variations for Glutes: 
   1. **Standing Variations** - some glute machines place extra resistance, either behind the knee or on the achilles tendon.
   2. **Prone Variations** - By lying on the floor, you increase the resistance but decrease the range of motion.
            - lie on your abdomen and support yourself on your forearms with a slight arch in your lower back.
            - You can also perform a superman version in which you start prone with your legs out behind you and your arms straight ahead and raise your legs and arms simultaneously. This variation also works the lower back and the backs of the shoulders
    3. **Kneeling Variations**(often called a donkey kick variation)- By kneeling, you increase both the resistance and the range of motion. Use an elastic band, an ankle cuff weight, or an ankle cable attachment to place extra weight on the glutes. For an added challenge, positioned on your hands and knees, simultaneously lift the opposing arm and leg. Instead of kneeling on the floor, you can place the rested knee on a bench to further increase the range of motion of the movement and therefore its difficulty.
    4. **Machine Variations** - machines called Butt Blasters add extra resistance on the soles of yourfeet to render the exercise more intense and more effective. Note that there is a difference in the movement because the knee joint is mobilized.As a result, in addition to recruiting the glutes and the hamstrings, the quadriceps also come into play.
    
## 2. Bridge
The bridge belongs in the basic, multiple-joint exercise category because the hip, knee, and ankle joints are mobilized. as a result, the bridge recruits muscles in addition to the glutes: the lumbar muscles and thighs.

###### How to Do It
Lie on your back with your knees bent at 90 degrees. place your arms by your sides. Using your shoulders as a pivot point, raise your torso by contracting your glutes as tightly as possible while pushing on your heels. hold the contracted position for one second before returning to the starting position. make sure you use constant tension by stopping each repetition short of touching the floor with your glutes.

**Pros**
 - It is a very easy exercise to perform to tone your whole legs, especially the glute muscles.
 - It can be performed at home without much equipment.

**Cons**
 - You will progress very quickly, which will force you to find ways to render this exercise more challenging.

 **Tips**:
 - Place your hands on the sides of your glutes to better feel them working.
 - To increase your range of motion, don’t arch your lower back too much.
 - Keep your lower back really straight. If you overextend it, you may damage your discs.
 - Look at the ceiling so that you do not damage your cervical spine.
 - No machine can duplicate this body weight exercise. 
 
  **Variations**:
When this exercise becomes too easy, you may render it more effective by doing any of the following:
 - Add an extra load on your body by placing a weight on the lower part of your abdomen.
 - Place your calves or feet on a bench or chair to achieve a greater range of motion requiring a more powerful muscle contraction.
 - Lift one leg.
 ![bridge-leg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/bridge-leg.png)
 ![bridge-bench](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/bridge-bench.png)
 
## 3. One-Leg Butt Press
The butt press recruits muscles in addition to the glutes: the lumbar muscles and thighs.

**Pros**
 - This exercise stretches your glutes like no others can. You will feel them contract immediately

**Cons**
 - You have to work one leg at a time, which makes this exercise more time-consuming than bilateral exercises.
 - Because it is unilateral, this exercise places an uneven pressure on your lower back, which might exacerbate any existing pain or damage.

 **Tips**:
 - Do not arch your back too much as you straighten your leg in an attempt to get a more powerful contraction of the glutes. If your back is pain free, a little arching of the lower back is fine, but excessive arching can damage your discs.
 - If you don’t have access to an assisted pull-up machine, you can perform a one-leg step up.
 ![leg-press](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/leg-press.png)

 
 ## 4. Lateral Hip Abduction
In case you want to have rounder Glutes this is the exercise for you.The lateral hip abduction does not recruit muscles other than its primary targets: the gluteus medius and the gluteus minimus.

**How to Do It**
Lie on your side with your bottom hand either flat on the floor or supporting your head and your top hand resting on the floor. By contracting your glutes, raise your leg as high as possible. Hold this contraction for a count of 2 before lowering your leg. Make sure you use constant tension by stopping each repetition short of your legs touching each other. Keep your body, especially your legs, straight at all times throughout the exercise. By lying laterally on the floor, you increase the resistance but decrease the
range of motion. The working leg can be either kept straight (harder version) or bent (easier version).

**Pros**
 - Studies have shown that the lateral hip abduction is the best exercise to target the gluteus medius, the toning of which provides a rounder appearance to your glutes.

**Cons**
 - This exercise works only a tiny portion of the glutes. as a result, it should make up only a small fraction of your glute workout.
 - When performed in a unilateral fashion, this exercise might place an uneven pressure on your lower back, which could exacerbate
any existing pain.
 - Arching your back allows a greater range of motion, but this is dangerous for your lower back.

 **Tips**:
 - If your knees shake laterally during squats or lunges, your abductor muscles are too weak. abductor exercises will correct this problem and therefore better protect your knees.
 - Using your free hand to touch the part of your glutes you want to develop enhances your brain–muscle connection. This simple maneuver
enables you to feel your working muscles more, rendering the exercise more effective.
 - You can elevate your leg laterally only so far. Some women have a greater range of motion than others. this is not due to greater flexibility,but rather to the shape of their bones. 
 
**Standing Variations**
The easiest way to perform the lateral hip abduction is standing because the range of motion is short and gravity results in little resistance placed on the gluteus medius. 
![standing-hip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/standing-hip.png)

**Kneeling Variation**
By kneeling, you increase both the resistance and the range of motion. In the kneeling version, you have to bend your leg to move it up laterally.
![kneeling](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/kneeling.png)

**Machine Variations**
Two kinds of machines are available to increase the resistance on your legs and make the exercise more effective.
  1. Seated, allows you to work both legs simultaneously. By bending forward or backward on the seated machine, you can shift the area of the glutes that experiences the majority of the contraction. By bending backward, you favor the recruitment of the upper area of the external part of the glutes. By bending forward, you favor the recruitment of the middle area of the external part of the glutes.
![seated](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/seated.png)

  2. Standing position - Some standing machines allow you to train both legs at a time; whereas others, only one. In both versions, the movement is the same as that of the other variations.
 
**Free Weights or Machine?**
All of the lateral hip abduction variations are relatively similar. Their main differences relate only to the degree of resistance placed on the glute muscles and to the range of motion of the movement. ankle cuffs, elastic bands, and machines render the movement more effective in terms of muscle toning by adding extra resistance, thereby increasing the difficulty of the movement. 


# Tone Your Quadriceps

**Anatomy and Morphology**:

As its name implies, the quadriceps contain four muscles:
  1. The vastus lateralis, on the outside of the thigh;
  2. The rectus femoris, in the center;  
  3. The vastus medialis, on the inside of the thigh;
  4. The vastus intermedius, which is mostly covered by the other three muscles;
  
![Quadriceps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/quadriceps.png)

The main issue for women is defining how big (or small) they want their quadriceps to be. The answer is far from universal, and culture can influence preferences. In Brazil, for example, many women desire huge glutes and quadriceps. In Europe, the goal is more often to maintain thin legs. Women in the United States are more in the middle; many desire some toning to create athletic legs. Of course, these are generalizations and are not true of all women in these societies. The size of the quadriceps is a matter of taste for each woman. Most do not want to be able to see each muscle that makes up the quadriceps, because such defnition is considered a very manly feature. Therefore, you likely do want to keep some fat on your legs to hide the muscular defnition of the quadriceps.  If training the quadriceps is secondary to glute training for you, you will be happy to know that most of the basic quadriceps exercises also recruit the glutes and hamstrings.

**Quadriceps Exercises** - There are four main categories of exercises for the quadriceps from which women can benefit:
  1. Squats
  2. Leg press
  3. Lunge
  4. Leg extension
 
## 1. Squats

**How to Do It**
Stand with your feet about shoulder-width apart, and place a barbell on your upper back. Keeping your back arched very slightly backward, bend your legs just until your torso starts to really bend forward. When this happens, thigh involvement lessens and the lumbar muscles begin to do the majority of the work. When you have reached your low position, push down through your heels
to straighten your legs. Once you are upright, perform another repetition.

**Pros**
 - The whole lower-body and part of the upper-body muscles are recruited, which makes the squat one of the most complete exercises.

**Cons**
 - The squat is a very difficult exercise to perform and requires athletic skills a beginner may not have.
 - Because this exercise is exhausting, it carries some risk for the knees and back. Hanging at a pull-up bar to stretch your spine after your workout is advised, as it is with every workout.

 **Tips**:
 - Whenever you use a barbell, do not place it on your neck because doing so is likely to hurt your spine. Place the bar below your neck, roughly at your rear shoulder level. If the bar hurts, put a towel around it to make it more comfortable.
![squats-bar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/squats-bar.png)

 - In order to increase the muscular intensity of the squat, use a continuous tension technique. This means that instead of allowing your leg muscles to rest at the top of the movement by completely straightening your legs, you stop your squat short and don’t straighten your legs completely. perform as many repetitions as possible using continuous tension. When the burn becomes unbearable, straighten your legs at the top of the movement in order to give your muscles a short rest, which will allow you to perform a few extra reps.
 
 - Placing a thin board of wood or a weight plate under your heels will make it easier to keep your back straight as you go down. This trick is particularly helpful if you have long femurs or inflexible ankles.
 
 ![squats-board](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/squats-board.png)
 
 - In order to protect your spine from excessive damaging pressure, as your muscles grow stronger, we recommend that you don’t perform
both squats and deadlifts during the same workout. As you advance in your training, center your leg workouts around squats and save the deadlifts for your back workouts.
   - Don't look down or to the side when performing a squat. rather, look in front of you and slightly up to avoid damaging your neck.
   - Rounding your back, especially at the end of a set when your muscles are tired, is much easier than keeping your back straight, but this rounded position increases the risk of damaging your lumbar discs.
   
   ![round-back](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/round-back.png)

### Squats and the importance of Stance Width
Varying the width of your feet during the squat can change the muscles targeted. Keeping them at about shoulder width and slightly turned out results in the __muscles of the entire thigh doing equal work__. When you narrow your stance, __the focus is on the quadriceps__, and __the knee joints__ experience greater pressure. Adopting a very **wide stance** works the __inner thighs, hamstrings,
and glutes__. As with all variations, choose the one that feels most natural to you at first. Later, you can adopt a position that targets particular muscular zones.
 ![Stance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/stance.png)
 ![Powersquat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/powesquat.png)
 
### Body Weight Variations Squats
The easiest squat version is the free squat, in which you use only your own body weight. You can practice this exercise at home to tone up your legs without having to go to the gym. The main problem is that body weight squats rapidly become too easy because of the lack of resistance. Choose the arm position(with arms crossed in front or down at the sides) that feels the mostcomfortable and secure for you; arm position does not alter the recruitment of the leg muscles. Alternatively, you can do one-leg squats, which are much harder than
regular squats and do not put pressure on the spine. If this variation is new to you, make sure you control the degree of descent, because the maximal range of motion of the one-leg squat can be much greater than that of the regular squat. going as deep as possible may result in profound muscular soreness after your workout. Therefore, increase your range of motion gradually over several workouts.

![free-squat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/free-squat.png)

### Squat Depth
The deeper you lower the weight, the more intense the squat becomes, because as you increase your range of motion, you are not recruiting only your quadriceps. Your hamstrings and especially your buttocks are going to be heavily recruited, as well. So, it seems to be a good idea to squat deep. From a muscular stand point, this is correct. But this is also where your morphology will come into play. The taller you are, the more you will have to bend your torso forward in order to keep your equilibrium as you squat down. In this position, the risk of spinal injury increases dramatically. Many people claim that bending the torso forward during a squat is bad
technique. But morphologically, if you have long quadriceps and a shorter torso, it is mechanically impossible to keep your back straight as you go down in squats. You must bend forward to keep your balance. This is why it is easier to keep your back straight using a Smith machine because there is no balance issue! If you find that you have to bend forward to a dangerous level in free squats, you would be wise to find an alternative to this exercise rather than waste hours trying to master a technique that you cannot perform morphologically.

![deep](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/deep.png)


### Dumbbell Variations
 - When you grab one dumbbell between your legs, your thighs have towork harder, rendering the squat more effective. as an alternative, you can use a strong elastic band or squat on one leg only.
- Grabbing two dumbbells adds even more resistance. The main advantage of dumbbells over a barbell is that they make it easier to keep your back straight and to keep your balance. however, as you grow stronger, dumbbells will not offer the resistance required to progress even more. This is when graduating to a long bar is required. By then, you should be able to keep your balance despite the overload placed on your legs. 

![dumbell](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/dumbell.png)

![dumbell-1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/dumbell-1.png)

### Resistance Band Variation
An elastic band can replace dumbbells. The main advantage of the resistance band is that it provides a variable resistance that suits your muscular strength exactly. At the bottom of the movement, where your muscles are weaker, the band offers less resistance. as you straighten your legs and your muscles get stronger, the band gets pulled and therefore offers more resistance.

![resistance-band](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/resistance-band.png)


### Front squat Variation
 - The front squat allows you to keep your back straighter than you can with the classic back squat. Doing the front squat variation it shifts the muscular recruitment from the glutes to the quadriceps, which may not be your goal if your main focus is glute development. Furthermore, carrying the bar on the front shoulders will feel very uncomfortable for many women. Moreover, mastering proper front squat technique is difficult. Without it, you will be very prone to losing your balance. as a result of these problems, the front squat is not a top leg exercise for most women.

![front-squat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/front-squat.png)

### Smith Machine Variation
Smith machines can be a good substitute for free-weight squats because the guidance they offer reduces the likelihood of accident due to a loss of balance. On a Smith machine you can place your feet forward, which allows you to keep your back very straight. In that position, you are recruiting your glutes while sparing your spine and your knees. Because of the stability of the Smith machine, you can easily keep your balance. Therefore, it is an excellent substitute for free squats, especially for beginners.

![Smith Machine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/smith.png)

The Smith machine also allows you to adopt just about every foot position you wish to better target the areas of your lower body you
want. Following are foot positions and the muscles they tend to recruit:

![Smith Machine Variations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/smith-1.png)

> FREE WEIGHTS or MACHINE?
> There are plenty of squat machines. Their main advantage is that they are less hazardous than the free squat because you have no
> degree of freedom in terms of the trajectory of the movement. Therefore, it is much harder to lose your balance. This is especially   > important for beginners with no athletic background.


## 2. Leg Press
The leg press belongs in the basic, multiple-joint exercise category because the hip, knee, and ankle joints are mobilized. As a result, the leg press recruits muscles in addition to the quadriceps: the glutes, hamstrings, and calves. The leg press is considered safer than the squat because it places less pressure on the lower back (which does not mean no pressure). Furthermore, the seat of the leg press machine offers good back support, which limits the risks of an accidental back twist. Also, because the trajectory of the movement is completely guided by the machine, fewer balance problems occur. There are plenty of versions of the leg press. You can sit or lie in the seat. 

**How to Do It**
Sit in the machine with your feet about shoulder-width apart on the foot platform. Keeping your back as straight as possible, bend your legs. Do not go all the way down! Stop whenever you feel your buttocks start to lift off the seat. At that moment, push with your thighs to straighten your legs. Once they are almost straight, perform another repetition.

**Pro**
  - Because the movement is guided and the lower back is well supported, the leg press is one of the safest lower-body exercises.
  
**Cons**
  - Some leg presses are poorly designed, and even a very good leg press machine may not suit your morphology.
  - The leg press may seem to be totally safe for the lower back. It is not! Although it is much safer than the squat, your spine will receive a great deal of pressure especially if you use an ample range of motion.

![Leg Press](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/leg-press.png)
  
 **Tips**
  - The wider your stance or greater your step is, the more your glutes and hamstrings have to work. Leaning your torso forward a little has the same effect.
  - Lifting your low back off the seat increases the range of motion of the exercise and enhances the recruitment of your glutes. however, although this may seem like a great idea, it will endanger your lower back. So, we do not recommend it.


**Variations**
  1. **Varying level of descent** -  The lower you go, the more difficult the press becomes because it recruits a growing number of muscle groups. However, the level of descent must take into account not only the muscles you want to focus on but also your morphology. The longer your legs are, particularly your thighs, the more dangerous it is for your lower back and your knees if you go very low. An unfavorable leg-to-torso ratio will result in your having to lift your buttocks off the seat to keep lowering the foot platform, which increases the tension on your spine.
  2. **Varying foot placement** - You can adopt just about any foot position you wish to better target the muscle group you want. Following are foot placements and the muscles they recruit:
  
  a. High on the platform: glutes and hamstrings (spares the knees)
  b. Low on the platform: quadriceps (this position is tougher on the knees)
  c. Together: quadriceps
  d. Wide apart: adductors

![Leg Press Position](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/legpress-pos.png)

## Lunge
The lunge belongs in the basic, multiple-joint exercise category because the hip, knee, and ankle joints are mobilized. as a result, the lunge recruits muscles in addition to the quadriceps: the glutes, hamstrings, and calves.

**How to Do It**
From a starting position with your feet together and both legs straight, take a step forward with your right leg. At first, go down about 8 to 10 inches (about 20 cm). As you get stronger, you will be able to use a greater range of motion to make the exercise more difficult. Once you reach the bottom position, push back up with the right leg. Don’t straighten the right leg completely; keeping a slight bend maintains constant tension in the muscles. after completing a set with the right leg, move on to the left leg with minimal rest. 
![Lunges](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/lunges.png)

**Pros**
  - Lunges are both a muscle builder and an excellent stretching movement.
  - If you had to select only one leg exercise, it should be lunges; they recruit the quadriceps, hamstrings, and buttocks.
  - Very little equipment is required to perform lunges.
  - Body weight lunges will provide very little lower back stress. Even weighted lunges are far safer for the spine than squats.
  
**Cons**
  - Working one leg at a time can be time-consuming.
  - The farther or more heavily you step, the more stress your kneecap will receive.
 
**Tips**
  - Rest your free hand (if you have one) on the muscle you want to isolate (glutes or quadriceps) to better feel the muscle contracting.
  - The wider your stance or greater your step is, the more your glutes and hamstrings have to work. Leaning your torso forward a little has the same effect.
  
![Lunges](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/lunges-1.png)

## 3. Leg Extension
The leg extension belongs in the isolated, single-joint exercise category because only the knee joint is mobilized. as a consequence, the leg extension does not recruit many of the muscle groups surrounding the quadriceps. Leg extensions are often used to warm up the knees at the beginning of a leg workout.

**How to Do It**
Sit in a leg extension machine and position your feet under the padded frame. Using your quadriceps, straighten your legs. Keep the contracted position for at least one second before bending your legs and repeating the movement.
![Leg Extension](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/leg-extension.png)

**Pro**
  - Unlike most quadriceps exercises, there is no compression of the spine
  
**Cons**
  - The leg extension is used to increase the definition of each head of the quadriceps. The glutes are not recruited at all; therefore, if glute development is your main goal, this is not the best exercise for you.

**Tips**
  - Put your hands on your quadriceps to better feel the contraction.
  - Don’t arch your lower back in an attempt to create a stronger quadriceps contraction.
  
**Variation**
If you don’t have access to a leg extension machine, you can perform the exercise while sitting, one leg at a time. You can also use a pair of ankle weights for added resistance.

![Leg Extension](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/leg-extension-1.png)

## Shape Your Hamstrings

The hamstrings (the backs of the thighs) contain a group of four heads:
  #### 1. Biceps femoris, short head
  #### 2. Biceps femoris, long head
  #### 3. Semimembranosus
  #### 4. Semitendinosus
 
**Take-Home Lesson for Women

The hamstrings’ placement just below the glutes helps enhance the feminine curvature of the buttocks. Having round buttocks and flat hamstrings would look odd. The hamstrings should be round as well, to accentuate the roundness of the glutes. The adductors are not muscles you want to make bigger. They just need to be very slightly toned. More important, they should be trained with light weights and high repetitions (no more than 25) to prevent the accumulation of unaesthetic fat deposits on them. Another good reason for using lighter weights is that the adductors are very fragile muscles that are easily overstretched and torn. So, little weights with higher repetitions are perfect for them.

#### Hamstring Exercises
There are three main categories of exercises for the hamstrings, plus one for the adductors, from which women can benefit:

`1. Stiff-leg deadlift`

`2. Lying leg curl`

`3. Seated leg curl`

`4. Thigh adduction`



## 1. Stiff-leg Deadlift
The stiff-leg deadlift belongs in the isolated, single-joint exercise category because it mostly mobilizes the hip joint only, even though other joints are placed under extreme tension during the exercise. As a result, the stiff-leg deadlift recruits muscles in addition to the hamstrings: the glutes, lower back, and quadriceps. It differs from the other hamstring exercises in that it provides a strong muscle stretch.

**How to do it**
With your feet about shoulder-width apart and your back arched very slightly backward, bend over and lift two dumbbells or a barbell from the floor. Use a natural hand grip with dumbbells—that is, a semi-pronated grip that is somewhere between neutral (thumbs forward) and pronated (thumbs facing each other). Use a pronated grip with a bar. Stand up using the strength of your hamstrings and your glutes while keeping your legs semistraight. Once you are standing, bend forward without bending your legs to return to your starting position. The weights do not have to touch the floor before you start another repetition.

![Stiff Leg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/stiff-leg.png)

![Stiff Leg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/stiff-leg1.png)


**Pro**
  - This is the best exercise for working the hamstrings intensely.
  
**Cons**
  - Because it stretches the hamstrings very intensely, this exercise can cause intense soreness that may last a few days.
  - Although the stiff-leg deadlift may seem easy, it is actually much more dangerous than it appears. Maintaining both your balance and good technical execution can be difficult. Bending your spine and pulling too much with your back rather than your hamstrings can allow you to use more weight or do more repetitions, but this will reduce the workload on your hamstrings and make this exercise dangerous for your spine.

**Tips**
  - If you have good flexibility, consider leaning forward with your torso parallel to the ground; then stand up. If this places too much tension on either your spine or your hamstrings, stop the movement short of parallel.
  - Do not bring your torso up until it is perpendicular to the floor. By not coming all the way up, you maintain continuous tension in the hamstrings. Only at failure should you come all the way up and rest for a few seconds so that you can perform a few more repetitions.
  - When the lumbar muscles tire, maintaining the slight natural arch of the back is difficult. As a result, the spine will start to curve. When this happens, reduce the range of motion so that you can always keep your back straight. The same problem occurs with the good morning variation described next.
  
**Variation**
Instead of holding the weight with your hands, you can put the bar on your upper back just as you do with squats and bend as in the standard stiff-leg deadlift just described. This variation is called a good morning. This variation will target the lower body more while reducing the involvement of the upper-body muscles, especially the lats, the lower trapezius, and the arms.

![Deadlift](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/deadlift.png)

![Deadlift](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/deadlift1.png)


## 2. Lying Leg Curl
The lying leg curl belongs in the isolated, single-joint exercise category because only the knee joints are mobilized. As a result, it recruits only the hamstrings and part of the calves.

#### How to Do It
Place your ankles beneath the pad of the moving arm of the machine and lie facedown on the machine. Using your hamstrings, bring the pad up to your buttocks. At the top of the movement, hold the contraction for two seconds and bring your feet back toward the floor. repeat before you have completely straightened your legs.

**Pro**
  - This exercise really isolates the backs of the thighs, which increases your awareness of these hard-to-feel muscles.
  
**Cons**
  - The leg extension is used to increase the definition of each head of the quadriceps. The glutes are not recruited at all; therefore, if glute development is your main goal, this is not the best exercise for you.

**Tips**
  - Put your hands on your quadriceps to better feel the contraction.
  - Don’t arch your lower back in an attempt to create a stronger quadriceps contraction.

![Machine Curl Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/machine-curl.png)

**Leg Curl Variations**
Dumbbell Variations - Holding a dumbbell between your feet renders the exercise much more productive. An incline bench is even more effective as shown below:

## 3. Seated Leg Curl
The seated leg curl belongs in the isolated, single-joint exercise categorybecause only the knee joints are mobilized. As a result, it recruits only the hamstrings and part of the calves.

###### How to Do It
Sit in the machine and place your ankles on top of the pad of the moving arm of the machine. Using your hamstrings, bring the pad down toward your buttocks. At the bottom of the movement, hold the contraction for two seconds and bring your feet back up. Repeat.

![Seated Leg Curl](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/seated.png)

**Pro**
  - There is a very powerful contraction of the hamstrings making it the best machine exercise for this muscle
  
**Cons**
  - With some machines, it is simply not possible to move the torso forward, even slightly.

**Tips**
  - Perform this exercise in a slow and controlled manner, not explosively. Do not straighten your legs completely in the stretched position so that you maintain continuous tension in the hamstrings.
  - Don’t arch your lower back as you contract your hamstrings.
  
 **Advanced Variation**
Even though this is technically an isolation exercise, the seated leg curl is a multiple-joint exercise if you move your torso forward as you bring your legs down. As you contract your hamstrings, they become progressively weaker, which forces you to arch your lower back. This demonstrates the physiological absurdity of staying firmly seated during the entire exercise. By moving your torso forward as your legs move backward, your hamstrings will become progressively stronger instead of weaker as the repetitions go on. Your range of motion in the contracted position will be greater, and there will be no arching of the lower back. The farther you bring your legs under you, the more you lean forward. While the legs are bending to 90 degrees, the torso is bending to 45 degrees. The reverse happens when you extend your legs.

## 4. Thigh adduction
The thigh adduction belongs to the isolated, single-joint exercise category because only the hip joints are mobilized.
This is considered a good finishing exercise for the legs because it is relatively easy to perform even when tired as a result of previous thigh movements.
![Thigh adduction](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/tight.png)

#### How to Do It
Sit in the machine and place your legs behind the pads of the moving arms of the machine. Using your adductors, squeeze your legs together. When they are as close as possible, hold the contraction for a count of 5 before returning to the starting position. With most machines, you have to sit. You can also perform the movement while standing because even if standing is not as comfortable as sitting, it is a more efficient way to work the adductors.

![Thigh adduction Machine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/machine.png)

**Pro**
  - It is hard to really isolate the adductor as well as this exercise does. 
  
**Cons**
  - Getting in and out of some machines may prove difficult. Make sure you do not overstretch your adductors when doing so.

**Tips**
  - Perform this exercise very slowly over a short range of motion.
  - It is almost impossible to isolate the adductor muscles with free weights. This is a situation in which machines are very handy. If no machine is available, you can substitute with a **cable**, but adductor machines are easier to master.

## Trim Your Calves

#### Anatomy and Morphology
The calves are composed of two main heads:
 1. The gastrocnemius, which provides most of the muscle mass of the calf.
 2. The soleus, which is covered by, and has much less mass than, the gastrocnemius.

![Calves](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/calves-muscles.png)

In some women, the calf muscles are very long with short tendons, whereas in others, they are very short with long tendons. No exercise will change this genetically predetermined muscle length. Long muscles are easier to develop than shorter muscles.
The soleus, being a single-joint muscle, is recruited in all the calf raise variations, whether the leg is bent or straight. The gastrocnemius, being a multiple-joint muscle, can only be recruited when the legs are straight or at most only slightly bent.

#### Take-Home Lesson for Women

- Because the calves are not a muscle most women want to develop, these aren’t the muscles you want to start your workout with. The priority should therefore never be given to calf exercises. Doing calf exercises first would ruin your lower-body workout.
 - The calves are probably one of the most exposed muscle groups (in addition to the arms). Many women aren’t seeking large, defined calves but instead are interested in toning these muscles. Therefore, the main goals of calf training should be maintaining proper blood circulation, building some strength, and maintaining good flexibility. As a result, one or two sets of 20 repetitions should be performed at least once a week at the end of leg training. In some cases, cardio training is more than enough for the calves. If excessive body fat covers your calves, the diet plus cardio training should take care of the problem. 
Nevertheless, stretching the calves is very important especially if you wear heels because they tend to shorten and stiffen the calves’ tendons.
 - There are also many angles from which to stretch your calf muscles. As a general rule, do the following while stretching your calves to have the following effects:
  • Keep your leg straight to primarily stretch the gastrocnemius muscle.
  • Bend your leg to stretch the soleus muscle.
  • Twist your ankle to the side to stretch the lateral muscles of the calves.
Just perfomr the standing cald stretch. 
 - The exercise below stretches the muscles on the outside of the calves. These are the muscles you strain when you violently twist your ankle. Because the slightest excessive stretch of these muscles will prevent you from walking, it is important to work on flexibility to prevent injuries. Stand with your feet close together and put your weight on your left foot. Roll your right foot as far over to the side as possible. Slowly move your weight over to the right foot. You should do this stretch progressively and slowly so that you do not tear a muscle or a tendon. Once you have stretched the right foot, stretch the left foot.

![STReTCH THe CALveS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/calves.png)

#### Calf Exercise
Because the seated calf raise neglects the gastrocnemius, the standing straightleg calf raise is the only exercise from which women who are looking to shape their calves can benefit.

**How to Do It**
With the balls of your feet (or one foot) on a weight platform or board and your heels hanging off the edge, stretch your calves as much as possible by allowing your heels to hang below the platform. Then, rise up as high as you can onto the balls of your feet. Hold the contracted position for one second; then lower your heels to the floor. If you need to, hold on to a wall to maintain your balance.

**Pro**
  - This exercise really isolates the calf muscles.
  
**Cons**
  - If you are doing other leg exercises or cardio training, in many cases doing a separate exercise for the calves isn’t necessary.

**Tips**
  - You can perform the calf raise unilaterally to apply the weight of the whole body to one calf. Working one calf at a time provides
a better stretch and better contraction of the muscle, which increases the range of motion.
  - If you suffer from bad leg circulation, it is very important to train your calves often with very high reps to push back the blood and flush out any excessive water retention. Using your body weight as resistance, perform a set of 50 to 100 reps at home before bedtime or whenever you suffer from lower-body pain.
  - Many trainers recommend straightening the legs completely to work the gastrocnemius muscles, but the gastrocnemius muscle is actually stronger when the knees are slightly bent because of the more advantageous length–tension relationship.
  
**Barbell and Machine Variations**
 - Another alternative is to place a long barbell across your shoulders. However, you will not be as stable, and you will not benefit from as big a range of motion.
 - A seated or incline leg press machine can be used instead of a calf raise machine. The main advantage of these machines is that they stretch the calves even more because the seated position stretches the calves at the knee level and not at the ankle only. This double stretch is possible because the gastrocnemius is a multiple-joint muscle that can be flexed by the two joints it crosses. These machines also take a lot of pressure off your back. Leg press machines are a great alternative to standing calf raise machines.
 
 
## Flatten Your Abs

**Anatomy and Morphology** 
  - The abdominal wall is made up of a very complex mesh of muscles that belong to the group known as the core muscles:
      1. The rectus abdominis, commonly called the abs
      2. The external obliques, on both sides of the rectus abdominis
      3. The internal obliques, under the external obliques
      4. The transversus abdominis, under the obliques
      
The abdominal muscles contract on both ends. Exercises that lift the torso recruit the upper abdominal muscles mostly; those that lift the lower part of the body recruit the lower abdominal muscles (although, as with the upper abdominal muscles, not exclusively).

The oblique muscles are located on both sides of the abdomen. They support the spine and have a major role in rotating the pelvis.
Unfortunately, the lower abdominal muscles are much more difficult to target and develop than the upper abdominal muscles are. Consider the fact that you can perform leg raises mostly with the strength of your upper abdominal muscles. This makes leg raises harder to execute than crunches. However, the lower abdominal muscles have the largest role in protecting the spine and keeping off belly fat (which is where fat accumulates most easily). A good abdominal training regimen, therefore, works not only the upper abdominals but also the lower ones.

![Abs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/abs.png) 
      
**Take-Home Lesson for Women**
  - Even if you do not carry any extra body fat, you can suffer from a hanging belly because your abs lack muscle tone. By training them regularly for a couple of weeks, you can tighten them up, which will automatically flatten your abdomen. Even if your belly problems result from an excess of body fat, training your abs will shrink your belly for the same reason even if you do not lose an ounce of fat.
 - The good news, then, is that the benefits of an abdominal training program manifest in less than a month, providing very rapid gratification. Following the initial tightening of your abdominal muscles, you should get rid of some body fat to continue to shrink your belly and enhance your silhouette. Women often have one of the following very different goals as far as abs are concerned:
      • A very flat abdomen with as little fat as possible
      • A little abdomen with abdominal muscles covered by a very thin layer of fat
Although these goals may seem opposed, they have one thing in common: a well-developed abdominal muscle wall, as opposed to a fl abby belly hanging forward because of a lack of muscle tone. So, whatever your goal is, you must work your abdominal muscles hard.
      
      
**Core Muscles and Your Health**
When we speak of the abdominal muscles, the first image many associate with them is primarily cosmetic: prominent and well-defined abs are synonymous with a flat belly devoid of unnecessary fat. However, nature has not provided us with abdominal muscles to look pretty.
Our core muscles perform vital functions for **locomotion** and **health**. The acquisition of "six-pack abs" is therefore not the only reason to train your core muscles. 

![Abs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/abs1.png) 


Following are six good reasons to take care of your abs, in addition to the visual aspect:

   **1. Relief of muscle tension** - The lumbar muscles often remain overly contracted during the night, resulting in the spine not regenerating as it should during sleep. The person then wakes feeling tired and with a sore back. A few minutes of ab work before bed can be enough to relax the lower back and release spinal tension.
    
   **2. Protection of the spine** -  Along with the back muscles, the abs support the spine. A lack of abdominal tone increases tension in the intervertebral discs, resulting in an increased risk of lumbar degeneration.
   
   **3. Reduced risk of developing diseases such as type 2 diabetes** - Type 2 diabetes develops with age, largely as a result of an excessive accumulation of fat in the abdominal area.
   
   **4. Improved digestive health** - Abdominal work facilitates digestion, preventing bloating and constipation.
   
   **5. Increased athletic performance** -  The abs play an important role in all daily physical activities as well as in sports that require fast running or twisting of the core. 
   
   **6. Cardiovascular health** - Circuit training the abs is an excellent cardiorespiratory workout that spares the knees and hips.
      
      
**Evolution of the Modern Woman**
Women have not historically accumulated much fat on their bellies. However, the combination of birth control pills (especially those rich in progesterone) and an excess intake of dietary fat and sugar (e.g., soda, chocolate, bread, pasta, cake) has revolutionized genetics. More and more women now have a gut, like men. In this case, gender equality is not good! At menopause, the cessation of natural estrogen production upsets the hormonal balance. With lower levels of female hormones, the endocrine system tends to behave in a more masculine way. The result is a disruption of the sites of fat storage: Fat suddenly colonizes women’s bellies. For this reason, women must redouble their ab training efforts at the onset of menopause to minimize this reshuffling effect.

![Abs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/abs2.png) 

**Spotting Ineffective and Dangerous Abdominal Exercises**
The world of fitness is rife with fake abdominal exercises that are not only a waste of time but can also endanger the spine. Fortunately, there is an easy way to tell the good exercises from the bad ones. In a bad exercise, the lower back arches during the contraction; in a good exercise, the back is rounded. Exercises that arch the lumbar spine do not work the abdominal muscles effectively.

For example, exercises that involve putting your legs in the air for as long as possible and scissors movements while lying down
are “back breakers.” Because the abdominal muscles are attached to the pelvis and not to the thighs, they cannot make the legs move.
In addition to being dangerous, contraindicated movements are also painful. Because arching the back is dangerous for the lumbar discs, the abdominal muscles intervene to straighten the spine by contracting isometrically (i.e., without moving). Because local blood circulation is blocked during isometric action, the abdominal muscles are deprived of oxygen. Poor circulation also keeps the abdominal muscles from removing lactic acid, resulting in a buildup of large quantities which is also dangerous and counterproductive to good performance. Keep in mind that isometric contraction does not develop the abdominal muscles or burn fat.

**Warm Up the Abs**
You can either start or finish your workout with ab training. At the end of the training, there is no need for a specific warm-up; just do a very easy first set if you plan to overload your abs with extra weights. If you start your workout with ab work, do at least one light set of crunches before moving to harder exercises.

**Abdominal Exercises**
There are six main categories of exercises for the abdominal muscles from which women can benefit:
  1. Crunches
  2. Leg raise
  3. Side crunch
  4. Twist
  5. Static stability
  6. Plank
  
### 1. Crunches

The crunch belongs in the isolated, single joint exercise category. It does not recruit much of the muscle groups surrounding the abs and primarily targets the upper abdominal zone.

![Crunches](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/crunch.png)

**How to Do It**
Lie on the floor, with your feet either flat on the floor or on a bench (putting your feet up on a bench helps prevent the lower back from arching). Place your hands behind or to the sides of your head. Slowly, without jerking, lift your shoulders and then your upper spine off the floor. ause for two seconds at the top of the lift while maintaining a strong contraction in your abdominal muscles. Return slowly to the starting position and perform the exercise again, smoothly. Because emptying the lungs increases the contraction, exhale while contracting your abdominal muscles. Then, breathe in while lowering your torso to the floor. Be sure your head is in line with your spine.

![Crunches](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/crunch-basic.png)

**Pro**
  - The crunch is a simple exercise that targets the abdominal muscles while being easy on the spine.
  
**Cons**
  - The crunch is not an exercise that stimulates the muscles over a great range of motion. Instead, it produces a contraction over a rather small range (about 6 inches, or 15 cm). So, it is of the utmost importance to squeeze the abs as hard as possible during each repetition to make up for this limited motion.

**Tips**
  - You may be tempted to try to increase your range of motion by lifting your entire torso off the floor. This is no longer a crunch, but a sit-up. In a sit-up, the abdominal work is secondary and tension is greater in your lower back. A BOSU ball or a curved bench can help you increase your range of motion in a crunch, thereby enhancing the difficulty of the movement while providing extra support for your lower back. 
  -  Where you place your hands determines the difficulty of the crunch. The exercise is harder when your hands are behind your head, easier with your hands crossed on your chest, and easier still when you stretch your arms forward along your body. Consider this combination: Begin with your arms behind your head, and when you can’t do any more repetitions that way, stretch your arms out in front so that you can do a few more.
  
  ![Crunches](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/crunch-hands.png)
  
  - Don’t tilt your head up to look at the ceiling during crunches. With your head up, you are likely to arch your back. During abdominal exercises, keep your head tilted forward to keep your eyes on your abdomen, but don’t tilt so far forward that you strain your neck.
  
    ![Crunches](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/crunch-head.png)
  
  - Performing a crunch while stabilizing your feet (typically on a wall or by a partner) will enhance your lower back curvature but also puts pressure on your spinal discs. One study showed that whenever crunches or sit-ups were performed with the feet restrained,
the rectus femoris was recruited much more powerfully than it was when the feet were unrestrained. The **hip flexor muscles** come into
play far more powerfully when the feet are blocked.

   ![Crunches](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/crunch-feets.png)
      
   - If you use an incline bench instead of the floor to increase the difficulty of the exercise, you will have to block your feet to stabilize your body. The higher the inclination of the bench is, the more resistance the abs will have to overcome to raise your torso.
      
   ![Crunches](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/crunch-bench.png)
   
   
   - To better target the oblique muscles with the crunch, you can rotate your torso to the side instead of coming straight up. As mentioned earlier, the exercise is easier when you stretch your arms along your body and harder when you place both hands behind your head. It is also easier with your feet on the floor instead of raised in the air. To work your left side, gently move your right hand or elbow toward your left knee using your abdominal muscles. Do not try to touch your knee with your elbow; the movement generally stops halfway. Hold the contracted position for two seconds before lowering. 
   
     ![Crunches](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/crunch-oblique.png)
     
   Instead of keeping your legs still, you can bring one of them toward your torso in sync with your shoulder rotations in a variation often called a bicycle crunch because of the pedaling motion of the legs. This advanced variation is more difficult to perform because of the more intense oblique contraction it produces.
   
   ![Crunches](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/crunch-bycicle.png)
   
      
**Machine Variations**
   
  - Abdominal machines are plentiful. Unfortunately, many are not well designed. If you find one that allows you to contract your abs well, use it. But if it feels weird, especially at the lower back level, you are better off with crunches. A good machine lets you choose the precise level of resistance to place on your abs. Crunches might be too hard for a beginner and way too light for an advanced trainer. Machines accommodate everybody as far as resistance is concerned.

### 2. LEG RAISE
Leg raises recruit the abs as well as the hip flexors. When performed properly, they target the entire abdominal wall but emphasize
the lower abdominal area.

**How to Do It**
Leg raises can be performed while lying on the floor (the easiest version) or seated (harder) or while hanging from a pull-up bar
(the hardest variation).

**Lying leg raise:**
Lying on the floor with your arms at your sides and your legs bent to 90 degrees, lift your buttocks and then your lower back. Roll
slowly and stop when you feel your upper back starting to come off the floor. Imagine touching your lower abdominal muscles to your pectorali muscles. Although they will not actually touch, visualizing this will help you achieve the correct movement. Pause for at least two seconds at the top of the raise with your abdominal muscles strongly contracted. Return slowly to the starting position and stop before your buttocks touch the floor to maintain continuous tension. Keep your head straight on the floor during this exercise, taking care not to move your neck. It is possible to do leg raises that move the legs off the floor very little, but take in consideration that these variations are very effective to firm up your abs.

**Seated leg raise:**
Sit on the edge of a bench with your arms at your sides, holding on to the bench so that you remain perfectly stable. While keeping your legs bent to 90 degrees, bring your lower abdominal muscles up so that they push on the upper part of your abs by rounding your back rather than lifting your legs. The total range of motion is only a few inches or centimeters. Pause for at least two seconds in the upper position while deeply contracting your abdominal muscles. Return slowly to the starting position and repeat. The main problem with this variation is that it is harder to roll the abdominal muscles from low to high. The weight placed on the lower back interferes with the mobility of the spine. This exercise is difficult to do sitting down because, if you cannot roll well, muscles other than the abdominals will do the majority of the work.

**Hanging leg raise:**
To make the leg raise harder, you can perform it while hanging from a pull-up bar. Hang on to the bar with pronated hands (thumbs facing each other) about shoulder-width apart. Bring your legs to 90 degrees in relation to your torso so that your thighs are parallel to the floor. You can keep your legs straight (this makes the exercise a lot more difficult) or bring your calves under your thighs (this makes the exercise easier). An advanced combination consists of beginning with the legs straight and, at failure, bending the legs so that you can do a few more repetitions. Using your lower abdominal muscles, move your pelvis up while bringing your knees up toward your chest. Lift your pelvis as high as possible while rolling yourself up as much as you can. Hold the position for one second before lowering your pelvis. Be careful not to lower your legs past the point where the thighs are parallel to the floor. The hardest thing about this variation when you first try it is to keep your body from swinging too much. As you train more, you will learn to stabilize yourself naturally. Alternatively, specially designed ab benches or chairs provide back support to stabilize your body while hanging.

**Pro**
  - The lower abdominals are the most difficult muscles to work. The leg raise is the best exercise for learning how to work them.
  
**Con**
  - This exercise is easier done poorly than it is done well. If you feel a pulling sensation in your lower spine, you are performing the exercise incorrectly. Mastering this exercise to the point that you are contracting the lower part of your abdominal muscles properly takes time.

**Tips**
  - Arching your lower back works the wrong muscles and pinches the lumbar discs. The goal of this exercise is not so much lifting the legs, but lifting the hips, which lifts the thighs.

### 3.SIDE CRUNCH

This exercise isolates the obliques more than the oblique crunch does, which targets both the rectus abdominis and the obliques. 

**How to Do It**
Lie on your left side on the floor. Put your right hand behind your head to support it. Using your obliques, bring your right elbow
toward your right hip. Your left shoulder will come off the floor about an inch (2.5 cm) or so. Hold the position for one to two seconds before lowering your torso. Bring your left shoulder to the floor, but not your head, so that you can maintain a continuous tension in your obliques. Once you have finished a set on your left side, move immediately to your right side.

  <p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/side.png">
  </p>

**Pro**
  - This is the best exercise for working the obliques.
  - You will feel your muscles working immediately if you perform it correctly
  
**Cons**
  - Using heavy weights with side crunches increases muscle size, but large obliques and a bigger waist are not what you are looking for. Unless you are involved in a strength sport, do not use too heavy a weight when working your obliques. Light weights and long sets will help you eliminate the fat that easily accumulates in this area.

**Tips**
  - Rotate your torso slightly from back to front while contracting your obliques. This exercise is not meant to be performed in a straight line.
  - Place your left hand on your obliques so that you can better feel the muscles working.
  - Do not begin your ab routine with the side crunch. It is better to end your abdominal workout with the obliques rather than starting with them because your priority should be to work the rectus abdominis.
  
**Variations**
Where you place your free hand determines the degree of resistance during this exercise. The position described here (i.e., your hand behind your head) is an intermediate position. To increase the resistance, extend your arm away from your body and next to your head. To reduce the resistance, extend your arm toward your thighs, parallel to your body. onsider using a descending set strategy. Begin the exercise with our arm straight up by your head, and when you can’t perform any more repetitions that way, place your hand behind your head so that you can do a few more. When you reach failure again, stretch your arm down toward your legs so that you can continue the exercise. By using this descending set strategy, you will be able to induce a very profound muscle fatigue, and typically one set will be enough for each side, which will save you time.

### 4. TWIST
Twisting rotations belong in the isolated, single-joint exercise category. 
Their main advantage is that they attack “love handles” better than any other exercise does.


**How to do it**
  **(1) - Twist with a broomstick:** - Sit on a bench or stand up while holding a broomstick on your shoulders. Slowly rotate from
left to right using a reduced range of motion. Avoid jerky movements. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/twist-seated.png">
</p>

  **(2) - Twist with an elastic band:** - Attach a band to a fixed point that is at about shoulder height. Standing, grasp the band in both hands and step forward. The farther you step from where the band is attached, the greater the resistance will be. Standing with your legs apart to increase stability, rotate from right to left. Do not turn your torso more than 45 degrees. When you have finished working the right side, move immediately to the left side.
  
  **(3) - Twist with a machine:** -Sit, stand, or kneel, depending on the equipment. Slowly rotate from left to right. Do not exaggerate the range of motion.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/twist-machine.png">
</p>

**Pro**
  - This is one of only a very few exercises that target love handles. Even so, love handles are not easy to get rid of. A proper diet and specific exercises will help. 

**Con**
  - This exercise can exacerbate back problems. If you have any back problems at all, do not perform the twist.

**Tips**
  - Don’t try to rotate over the greatest range of motion possible. Use a reduced range of motion (no more than 10 in., or 25 cm, of rotation on each side). Slow your pace to make up for the short range of motion.
  - Do this exercise slowly using long sets (e.g., 25 repetitions). Performing two to four sets every day will combat love handles.
  - Do the twist while lying on the floor. Instead of moving your upper body, your legs perform the rotations. You can do the twist either with bent legs (easier) or straight legs (far more difficult).
  
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/twist-lying.png">
</p>
  
  -Twist while hanging on a pull-up bar with either bent legs (easier) or straight legs (much harder). This version provides the added advantage of decompressing the spine at the end of a workout

### 5. STATIC STABILITY
This static exercise targets the transversus abdominis and the obliques as well as many deep core muscles that support the spine.


**How to do it**
Press your lower back as powerfully as possible against a wall with your feet about two feet (55 cm) away from the wall. Once in position, slowly bring your feet closer to the wall by taking very small steps. As you move, your lower back should remain in contact with the wall. When you reach the point where you are losing contact, stop moving your feet and hold the position for at least 20 seconds.

</p>

**Pro**
  - Regular practice of this exercise helps to prevent back pain by training the core muscles that support the spine.
  - No machine allows you to directly contract the transversus abdominis. You can easily do this exercise at home, whenever you want and as frequently as you want, because no equipment is required.

**Con**
  - Because this exercise seems so easy, many women neglect it. This is a mistake.

**Tips**
  - Although this exercise looks easy, you will feel a very strong contraction in your abdominal muscles. Because these core muscles are not used to such a powerful contraction, you will be amazed at how fast they get tired.
  
  - If the wall version becomes too easy, perform it while standing without the wall for support.
  
  - If you cannot last 15 seconds in the standing position, do the exercise lying on the floor on your back with your legs bent at 90 degrees. gently stretch your legs without arching your back. The objective here is to push the lumbar spine as strongly as possible against the floor. When you feel the lower back lift off the floor, stop extending your legs. Avoid pushing on your heels to keep your lower back against the floor. When this floor exercise becomes too easy, stand up to do it leaning against a wall.

### 6. PLANK
The plank works most of the core muscles, and there is no machine for this exercise. Thus, you can do it at home whenever you want and as frequently as you want.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://yurielkaim.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Core-Muscles.jpg">
</p>

**How to do it**
Lie on the floor, facedown, resting on both your elbows and forearms and on the balls of your feet and your toes. Hold this static position for at least 15 seconds while keeping your body as straight as possible.

<p align="center">

</p>

**Pros**:
  - Because this isometric exercise requires no equipment, it can be done in very little time.

**Con**:
  - Isometric exercises are not the best for improving the aesthetic appearance of your abs. However, this exercise may be very appropriate for you if you require a strong core to compete in a combat or team contact sport.

**Tips**
  - If you experience any pain while putting your palms on the floor, make fists and put your hands in a neutral position (with only the pinkies in contact with the floor).
  - If the weight of your head becomes too uncomfortable, bend your neck forward to let it rest against your hands.
  - A gym mat (or at least a towel) will help you avoid pain in your forearms.
  - Don’t arch your lower back to make the exercise easier. If you bow your back excessively, you may pinch the intervertebral discs. 
  - A recent study suggests that the plank is three times more effective if you hollow your abdominal muscles (i.e., contract your glutes while tilting your pelvis slightly up and tucking your chest toward your abs).
  - To work the obliques, you can perform the exercise in a lateral position. If this version is too difficult, use your free hand for support by placing it on the floor in front of you.

## Curve Your Shoulders
  
**Anatomy and Morphology** 
The deltoid is the muscle responsible for moving the arm in all directions. Aesthetically, your shoulders define your build. The deltoid is divided into three parts:

     (1). The front of the shoulder, which lifts the arm in front or overhead;
   
     (2). The lateral part of the shoulder, which raises the arm to the side;
   
     (3). The back of the shoulder, which pulls the arm backward; 

The deltoid is a single-joint muscle because it crosses only the shoulder joint. On the other hand, because of its various heads, you can work this muscle from plenty of angles by raising your arms in front of you, overhead, laterally, and posteriorly.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/shoulders.png">
</p>

### Take-Home Lesson for Women
Most sedentary females suffer from an anterior deltoid tilt. Such poor posture hides the breasts and often creates back pain. Weight training the shoulders will improve your posture, prevent back pain, and make you look even more attractive. Curved shoulders, created by pulling your arms backward, not only bring your breasts up but also make you appear taller. Most women have a structural imbalance between the front and the back of the shoulders. 

<p align="center">

</p>

### Shoulder Exercises: 
There are three main categories of exercises for the shoulders from which women can benefit:

       (1). Lateral raise
       
       (2). Upright row
       
       (3). Bent-over lateral raise
   

Each category has several versions, which guarantees a great variety of movements and allows you to choose the ones that best suit both your anatomy and your goals.

**TIPS:**
  - The chest press already stimulates the front part of the shoulders. If you are seriously training your chest, it is not necessary to focus on the front of the shoulder, especially because this zone of the deltoid is the easiest to develop.
  - Performing both chest and shoulder presses places unnecessary stress on the shoulder, elbow, and wrist joints, which is likely to translate into pain and injuries. Avoiding the shoulder press will save you time and lighten the burden on your joints.
  - Overly developed front delts will deteriorate your posture.

#### 1. LATERAL RAISE
The lateral raise belongs in the isolating exercise category because only the shoulder joint is mobilized. As a consequence, the elevations do not recruit much muscle except the lateral part of the deltoids. This elevation of the arm is not very common in sports or in daily life, which explains why the role of the middle part of the shoulder is mostly aesthetic. The nice curve it provides justifies making the lateral raise the first exercise whenever shoulders are trained.


**How to do it**:
  - Grab two dumbbells or the handles of a cable or a machine. Raise your arms up while keeping them as straight as possible. At all times, keep them in line with your body. raise your arms until they are parallel to the floor. Stop for one second, bring your arms down, and repeat the movement slowly. The lateral raise can be performed with dumbbells, a machine, or a cable. Analyze the advantages and disadvantages of each version presented later in this section to choose the one that suits you best.


**Pro**:
  - Because the deltoids are very isolated muscles, they are conducive to drop sets when people want to work them deeply. You do not have to worry about any other muscle wearing out before the deltoids. As explained in part I, a descending set allows you to continue a set once you have reached fatigue without having to cheat. It involves briefly stopping the movement to rapidly remove around one third of the weight you are using and immediately resume your set. This allows you to continue the exercise and keep the muscle burn going. You can drop the load once or twice depending upon the level of muscular intensity you want to reach (the more drops you do per set, the more intense it   is for your muscles).

**Cons**
  - Many people are tempted to cheat in this exercise so they can handle heavier weight, which is counterproductive.
  - Almost any kind of lateral raise puts pressure on the lower back. Therefore, it is a good idea to use a lifting belt to reduce this pressure as much as possible.
  
  
  
##### Pro and Cons of Dumbell Lateral Raise: 
 (1) - **Pro**:
  - Equipment is readily available. You can use dumbbells or any kind of weight you can hold (e.g., water bottles).
  - You can better target the middle shoulder–rear shoulder tie-in by changing the orientation of your upper body (i.e., bending a little bit forward or laterally). If you do so, keep your spine straight and use a lifting belt to protect your lower back.
          
 (2) - **Cons**: 
  -  As you start raising your arms, most of the work is performed by the supraspinatus, not the deltoids. The deltoid muscles intervene only during the last two thirds of the movement. Because the supraspinatus is a fragile muscle, excessive stimulation is likely to result in chronic shoulder pain.
  - The deltoids receive only a weak prestretch. Because the resistance from dumbbells diminishes rapidly when the arms come back to the body, the deltoids are not stretched very much.
  - Of all the lateral raise versions, the dumbbell lateral raise is the least productive and the most traumatic.

</p>


##### Pro and Cons of Machine Lateral Raise: 
 (1) - **Pro**:
  - A good lateral raise machine is very effective because the resistance comes from the side. This is exactly the direction required to recruit the middle part of the deltoid. It is because the resistance of the dumbbells comes from the floor whereas free weights recruit the supraspinatus excessively.
    
 (2) - **Cons**: 
  - As with dumbbells, muscle prestretch is close to nonexistent, which reduces the range of motion of the exercise.
  - To get the maximum benefit from a machine, do your set by raising only one arm at a time. This way, you can place your working shoulder exactly within the axis of rotation of the machine. 
  - To better target the middle shoulder–rear shoulder tie-in, you can change the orientation of your upper body by bending a little bit forward or laterally. If you do so, keep your spine straight and use a lifting belt to protect your lower back.

</p>



##### Pros and Cons of Cable Lateral Raise: 
 (1) - **Pros**:
  - Low cable pulleys are more widely available than machines. They present a superior way of performing lateral raises in the safest manner possible;
  - The range of motion is increased because the pulley allows your arms to cross your torso in the bottom part of the movement. Your right arm can go much farther to the left and your left arm can go much farther to the right than either can with dumbbells or a machine.
    
 (2) - **Cons**: 
  - A cable makes it impractical to train both arms at the same time. You will have to work one arm at a time.
  - When the pulley has to remain close to the floor, the resistance does not come from the side very much, which reduces the involvement of the deltoid in favor of the supraspinatus, which isn’t a big improvement over dumbbells.
        
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://cdn-xi3mbccdkztvoept8hl.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/watermarked/Single_Arm_Cable_Lateral_Side_Raise.png">
</p>

**Tips**
  - With dumbbells or a cable, at all times during the exercise, the thumbs should be lower than the pinkie fingers so that you really focus your efforts on the lateral part of the deltoids.
  - With dumbbells, to train your shoulders really hard, start the exercise normally. At failure, move on immediately to dumbbell upright rows(discussed later). This is an advanced superset technique.
  - You can increase the range of motion of this exercise by raising your hands as high as possible rather than stopping them at shoulder level. If you do so, you should slowly rotate your hands so that your palms end up facing each other when the weights touch at the top of the movement. As you bring the weights down, slowly rotate the hands back so that your thumbs face the front as the dumbbells touch your legs. This variation will target your front shoulders and your upper trapezius more than the regular version.
  - With dumbbells, you can do this exercise while sitting or standing. In general, your execution form is better when sitting than when standing. One approach is to begin this exercise sitting down and, at failure, stand up so that you can perform a few more repetitions.
  

### 2. UPRIGHT ROW
The upright row recruits many muscles in addition to the shoulders: the upper trapezius, biceps, and forearms.

**How to do it** - Stand holding a barbell, dumbbells, or pulley handle using a pronated, palmsdown grip. Lift your arms while bending them, keeping your hands as close to your body as possible. You can lift the weight all the way to your chin, but many people prefer to lift the weight only as high as the chest.
        
<p align="center">

</p>


##### Smith Machine Upright Row: 
 (1) - **Pro**:
  - Because the weight does not have to be balanced, this version is very beginner friendly.
          
 (2) - **Con**: 
  - The hands are even less free to move than with a barbell, which increases the risk of twisting the wrists during the lift.
        
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://www.muscleandperformance.com/.image/t_share/MTQ1MzY2OTYwNjAyNjg3MDMx/image-placeholder-title.jpg">
</p>

##### Dumbbell Upright Row: 

 (1) - **Pro**:
  - The hand is completely free to move, which minimizes any unnatural twisting of the wrists and allows you to rotate your hands to optimize the recruitment of the lateral part of the deltoids.
          
 (2) - **Con**: 
  - Because of the freedom of movement of both arms, balancing the weight is challenging, which may be difficult for beginners. however, getting used to controlling the dumbbells so that both arms are lifted simultaneously happens quickly.
        
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://cdn-xi3mbccdkztvoept8hl.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/watermarked/Dumbbell_Upright_Row2.png">
</p>


##### Cable Upright Row: 

 (1) - **Pros**:
  - A low cable is much gentler for the shoulder joint than free weights are.
  - Performing this exercise while lying on the floor greatly minimizes the pressure placed on the spine. If you suffer from mild back pain and insist on training your shoulders, this is the version of choice.
  
 (2) - **Con**: 
  - If you are using a straight bar, you face the same wrist problems that you would with a barbell. If possible, use an EZ bar instead.
        
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://weighttraining.guide/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Cable-Upright-Row.png">
</p>


**TIPS:**
  - You must place your hands at the proper width to recruit the deltoids rather than the trapezius. Following are general rules: The wider the grip is, the less the trapezius will be involved. The higher you pull the bar, dumbbells, or pulley handle, the more
your trapezius will come into play.
  - Arching your lower back permits you to handle heavier weight, but it lso makes you more prone to spinal injuries.

</p>

  
### 3. BENT-OVER LATERAL RAISE
The bent-over lateral raise recruits many of the muscle groups surrounding the deltoids—namely, the upper back (trapezius, rhomboids, and part of the latissimus dorsi) as well as the long head of the triceps. Bent-over laterals can be performed with dumbbells, a cable, or a machine.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://www.worldwidelifestyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Bent-over-Lateral-Raise.png.jpg">
</p>
 
 **How to Do It: Dumbbells and Cable** 
  - With dumbbells or a cable, lean forward so that your torso forms a 90-degree to 120-degree angle to the floor. Grab the dumbbells or cable handle using a pronated, palms-down grip (thumbs toward each other). A neutral grip (hammer grip with thumbs facing the front) can also be adopted with the cable handle. Lift your arms to the sides as high as possible while keeping them as straight as possible. hold the contracted position for one to two seconds; then lower the weights.
  
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://weighttraining.guide/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Dumbbell-Rear-Lateral-Raise.png">
</p>

##### Pro and Cons of Dumbell Lateral Raise: 
 (1) - **Pro**:
  - Equipment is readily available. You can use dumbbells or any kind of weight you can hold (e.g., water bottles).
          
 (2) - **Cons**: 
  - This version places significant tension on the lower back.
  - The bent-over position may not be comfortable.
  - The range of motion of the exercise is limited by a lack of resistance in the stretched part of the movement.
   
##### Pro and Cons of Cable Lateral Raise: 
 (1) - **Pro**:
  - Because of the pronounced stretch at the bottom of the movement, a cable allows a much longer range of motion than dumbbells and even machines. Because the upper back region is difficult to develop, using the greatest range of motion possible, especially by increasing the stretched portion of the movement, is very effective.
          
 (2) - **Cons**: 
  - The cable makes it very impractical to train both arms at the same time. You will need to work one arm at a time, which will increase the duration of your training.
  - Unnecessary tension is placed on the lower back.
  - The bent-over position may not be comfortable.
 
**How to Do It: Rear Deltoid Machine*   
  - Sit in the machine and make sure the pad does not compress your breasts excessively, which may become painful as the set goes on. depending on the machine, you can adopt either a neutral (hammer) or pronated (palms-down) grip. Pull your arms to the rear as far as possible. hold the contracted position for one to two seconds before bringing your arms back to the front.
    
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_tplmUrUVw8/maxresdefault.jpg">
</p>


##### Pros and Con of Machine Lateral Raise: 
 (1) - **Pros**:
  - Machines are much safer for the lower back because most of them have you perform the movement in a seated position. As a result, the pressure on the spine is reduced compared to a bent-over standing position.
  - The seated position is also much more comfortable because breathing is easier than when you bend over to lift weights.
          
 (2) - **Con**: 
  - Machines are not readily available. If you do not have access to one, use a low pulley and work one arm at a time. Only in the absence of either a machine or a pulley do we recommend the dumbbell bent-over lateral raise.

**TIPS**:
  - The rear deltoid is the most neglected and most underdeveloped part of the shoulder. As discussed in the introduction of this section, women often neglect the backs of their shoulders. It is wise to work the rear of the shoulders as often as possible with the bent-over lateral raise. This is a key exercise for this area.
  - Perform this exercise using descending sets to make sure you really work the muscle to the maximum.
  - Keep your head very straight and look straight ahead with your gaze slightly upward to keep your back perfectly aligned
  - The movement is easier if you do not keep your arms perfectly perpendicular to your torso. drifting them downward allows you to use heavier weights, but it does not isolate your rear shoulders nearly as well. So, make sure you raise your arms straight up to your sides even if you have to lighten your weight to do so.


## Develop a Pain-Free Upper Back
  
**Anatomy and Morphology** 
Covering almost the entire back, the latissimus dorsi muscles create the torso’s V-shape. Anatomically, these are the muscles that pull the arms behind the body. In this task, they are assisted by the rear part of the deltoids, the middle and lower trapezius, and the rhomboids. The rhomboids stabilize the scapula, but you cannot see them as they are hidden by the trapezius. The trapezius muscles are divided into two major parts:

     (1). The upper trapezius muscles, which raise the shoulders;
   
     (2). The middle and lower trapezius muscles, which lower the arms and prevent the shoulder blades from winging
     
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/back.png">
</p>
  
### Take-Home Lesson for Women
At first the idea of strengthening your back for aesthetic reasons may sound strange. However, a back V-taper can make your waist and hips appear smaller. You do not need to develop an impressive back; you just have to define it a little. Overly developed upper traps (trapezius muscles) are not aesthetically pleasing on women. Therefore, women are counseled to avoid exercises such as shrugs, which directly stimulate the upper part of the trapezius.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/back1.png">
</p>

### Upper Back Exercises:
There are three main categories of exercises for the upper back from which women can benefit:

       (1). Row
       
       (2). Pull down
       
       (3). Pullover
       
Each category has several versions, which guarantees a great variety of movements and allows you to choose the ones that best suit both your anatomy and your goals.

### 1. ROW
Rowing recruits many muscles in addition to the entire back: the rear shoulders, the biceps, the long head of the triceps, and the forearms. The row is considered a good starting exercise because it stimulates many muscle groups of the upper body. 

##### How to Do It: 
- **Dumbbell row**: Lean forward so that your torso forms a 90- to 120- degree angle to the floor. Hold two dumbbells in a neutral grip with the thumbs forward. Some people prefer to have their thumbs slightly turned in, and others like them slightly turned out. 
Choose whichever position allows you the most powerful muscle contraction. 

<p align="center">

</p>


- **Barbell row**: Lean forward so that your torso forms a 90- to 120-degree angle to the floor. Grab a barbell with a supinated or pronated grip (see the Variations section for information to make the best choice for you).

<p align="center">

</p>


- **Cable machine row**: Lean forward so that your torso forms a 90- to 120- degree angle to the floor. Hold two dumbbells in a neutral grip with the thumbs forward. Some people prefer to have their thumbs slightly turned in, and others like them slightly turned out. choose whichever position allows you the most powerful muscle contraction.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://blog.nasm.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/NASMND14_WORKOUT_1.2_1208x808.jpg">
</p>

For all versions of the row, pull your arms along your body, bending them and bringing your elbows as far back as possible. Squeeze your shoulder blades together and maintain the contracted position for one to two seconds; then lower the weights and repeat. As a general rule, you should pull your hands back to your navel. Some people pull to their chests, and others, a little lower, near their thighs.

**Pros**:
- Rowing works the muscles of the entire back, particularly the middle and lower trapezius.
- Rowing is better than pull-downs at targeting the muscles that enhance posture.
- rowing is better than pull-downs at protecting the lower back.
  
**Cons**: 
- Leaning forward can interfere with breathing when working intensely.
- The leaning position places the spine in a precarious position.
- Rowing with both hands, especially with heavy weights, can put the back at risk. You can reduce this risk by not bending to the
often-recommended 90 degrees. Instead, lift your torso only until it is at a 120-degree angle to the floor. Because you may find it easier to feel your upper back muscles work from this position, you may feel stronger using it.
        
**TIPS**:
- Keep a continuous tension in your back muscles so you do not straighten your arms too much in the stretched position. Doing so will prevent the biceps and shoulder injuries that can occur from repeatedly straightening the arms too much.
- Keep your head straight, especially during the contraction phase of the exercise. Avoid turning your head to either side.
- With dumbbells and barbells, and on some machines, you can alter your grip. A neutral grip (thumbs facing up) provides the most strength and places your arms in a way that makes you less prone to damaging your biceps. A pronated grip (palms facing down) is possible, but it provides the least amount of strength and thus is not recommended.

### 2. PULL DOWN
The pull-down recruits many muscles in addition to the back: the rear shoulders, the biceps, the long head of the triceps, and the forearms.

##### How to Do It: 
- Sit at a high-pulley machine and grab the bar with supinated hands (palms up, pinkie fingers facing each other). Your hands should be about shoulder-width apart. You can also use a pronated grip (palms down, thumbs facing each other) to change the angle of attack for this exercise, as shown. In that case, use a wider grip. Vary the position of your hands until you find the one that works best for you. Using a close grip with supinated hands is easier than using a wider grip in pronation; however, the biceps work more and the back works less with this version. If you are a beginner, a supinated, close grip is good to use until your strength increases.
- A neutral grip is also an option; this grip allows you to be stronger than in a pronated position. The back muscles stretch more in the bottom position, but the range of motion is more limited in the contracted position. Pull the bar down at least to your forehead. If you feel comfortable enough, bring the bar to your upper chest. maintain the contracted position for one second before slowly returning the bar to its starting position. Do not straighten your arms completely before repeating. You have the option of bringing the bar in front of or behind the head. This latter version is the most difficult and the most traumatizing to the shoulder joints, and we don’t recommend it.

</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://www.bodyrecomposition.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/medpulldownback.jpg">
</p>


- **Chin-Up Variation**: As you gain strength from performing machine pull-downs, you will be ready to do chin-ups on a bar. To do so, grab the bar using a supinated grip (palms up) and with your hands about shoulder-width apart. pull your feet up behind you to create a 90-degree angle between your calves and thighs. cross your legs until your right foot pushes against your left ankle. ensure a good grip on the bar by placing your thumb on your index finger (and your middle finger if your thumb is long enough). Using your back muscles, pull yourself up until your forehead reaches the bar. If you can, bring your chin (or your neck) to the bar while tilting your
head back. Hold the contracted position for one second before coming down slowly. Do not straighten your arms completely. maintain continuous tension to prevent injuries. With chin-ups, your body tends to sway. To avoid this problem and keep your body straight, squeeze your buttocks together hard and push your right foot against your left ankle. This extra rigidity will keep you from swaying.
To increase the challenge when you can easily do 12 to 15 chin-ups with your body weight, you can add resistance by squeezing a dumbbell or medicine ball between your calves or your thighs.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://www.climbing.com/.image/t_share/MTM3MzI0NDMzMjY5MzM1MjA5/trainingperfectpullupsjpg.jpg">
</p>

**Pros**:
- In very little time, pull-downs work a very large section of the muscles in the torso.
- Pull-downs allow you to choose the resistance you want to apply to your muscles. You can increase this resistance by a small amount set after set, which is much harder to do with chin-ups.
  
**Cons**: 
- Many women, unfortunately, are unable to pull themselves up using a horizontal bar, which can be frustrating. To cope with this situation, chin-up machines can be very handy because they allow you to choose the resistance that suits your strength level so you can do a normal set.
        
**TIPS**:
- Never straighten your arms when performing the pull-down or the chin-up variation described later. Doing so creates an extreme stretch that puts the biceps and shoulders at risk of tearing. Instead, maintain continuous tension during the entire stretching part of the exercise. Some people straighten their arms to rest between repetitions. If youchoose to do this, keep in mind that your shoulder ligaments are in a vulnerable position when you are hanging; take extra care to resume the pull-down or chin-up smoothly, without jerking.


### 3. PULL OVER
The pullover recruits major muscles such as the latissimus dorsi and the lower traps and, to a lesser extent, the pectoralis and the long head of the triceps. The serratus anterior muscle might also come into play. Despite this large recruitment, the pullover is more a stretching exercise than a muscle-building one. It is a good way to increase the flexibility of your rib cag.

##### How to Do It: Dumbbell
- Lie supine on a bench with your head at the edge of the bench. Hold a dumbbell with both hands in a neutral grip (thumbs toward the floor) or a pronated grip (thumbs touching), bend your arms to 90 degrees, and move your arms above your head. keeping your arms bent, lower them behind your head. Bring them as lowas possible and then raise them back up. Do not bring the weight all the way back up. raise it only as long as you feel resistance; if this resistance disappears, you went too far to maintain continuous tension.

</p>


##### How to Do It: Machine
- Adjust the seat and grab the movement arm or bar using a pronated, supinated, or neutral grip (this will depend on the type of machine you are using). Pull the arms along the length of your body with the strength of your lats so that your elbows get as close as possible to the rear of your obliques. maintain the contracted position for one to two seconds while squeezing your shoulder blades together before raising your arms again and repeating the movement. If you do not have access to a machine, you can use a high pulley. With your arms straight and your hands close to each other, bring the bar down, keeping your arms straight.

</p>

**Pro**:
- If you feel only your biceps working and not your back muscles when performing chin-ups, pull-downs, or rows, then pullovers can really help you. This is because the biceps do not interfere during pullovers. Pre-exhausting your back muscles by starting with the pullover will allow you to feel your lats working more and your biceps less during pull-downs or rows.
  
**Cons**: 
- Because pullovers place the shoulder joints in a relatively unstable position, you should avoid using too much weight. To increase the work, increase the number of repetitions rather than the weight.
        
**TIPS**:
- Don’t train your triceps before starting pullovers; if you do, you run the risk of them being too tired, which will prevent the lats from working as hard as they are supposed to. By either keeping your arms straight or bending them a little, you can modify your position to minimize the recruitment of your triceps.
- If you are using an adjustable dumbbell, make sure any weights are securely attached because you do not want them to fall off when they are above your head!
- With dumbbells, as your muscles tire toward the end of the set, you may tend to pull more with one arm than the other. Try to pull in as perfect a line as possible to avoid damaging your shoulder joints.


## Protect Your Lower Back
  
**Anatomy and Morphology** 
- The lumbar muscles support the spine. When they are sufficiently developed, these muscles can take pressure off the spine. The lumbar muscles are also responsible for bringing the torso upright from a forward-leaning position. in this task, the lumbar muscles rarely work alone; they typically contract along with the glutes and the hamstrings. Studies have shown that lower back pain is directly related to weak lumbar musculature. Strengthening the lower back muscles is the best way to reduce lower back pain and prevent future back pain. So, it is much wiser to train your back as a preventive measure rather than once back pain has begun to affect your well-being.

### Take-Home Lesson for Women
The spine is a weak structure, especially as it ages. Weight training can both strengthen your muscles and increase your bone density, but it can also endanger your spine. Always be careful when you perform exercises that place pressure on your spinal column.

### Lower Back Exercises: 
There are three main categories of exercises for the shoulders from which women can benefit:

       (1). Deadlift
       
       (2). Hyperextension

Each category has several versions, which guarantees a great variety of movements and allows you to choose the ones that best suit both your anatomy and your goals.

### DEADLIFT:
Deadlift recruits many muscles in addition to the lumbar muscles: the latissimus dorsi, the glutes, the hamstrings, and the quads.
The deadlift is considered a good overall exercise because it stimulates so many muscle groups throughout the body. If you do not have much time to train, the deadlift will strengthen several muscles in the limited amount of time you do have.

##### How to Do It: Dumbbells
- With your feet shoulder-width apart and with a dumbbell beside each foot, bend your knees so your thighs are about perpendicular to the floor. Lift the dumbbells while keeping your back level. a semi-pronated grip, somewhere between a neutral grip (thumbs forward) and a pronated grip (thumbs facing each other) is ideal, but use whichever feels the most natural. allow your back to arch slightly backward to respect the natural curve of your spine. Push down through your heels and pull with your back to stand up. Synchronize the movements of your legs and back as much as possible. From the standing position, bend your legs while leaning to return to the
start position:

</p>

##### How to Do It: Barbell
- With your feet shoulder-width apart, bend your knees so your thighs are about perpendicular to the floor. Keeping your back level, use a pronated grip (thumbs facing each other) to grab the barbell from the floor. To handle heavier weights, place one hand in a supinated position with the palm up. allow your back to arch slightly backward to respect the natural curve of your spine. Push down through your heels and pull with your back to stand up. Synchronize the movements of your legs and back as much as possible. From the standing position, bend your legs while leaning forward to return to the start position.

</p>


**Pro**:
- Because this exercise works so many muscles in very little time, it is one of the most complete and economical weight training exercises.
  
**Cons**: 
- The number of muscles this exercise recruits can make it very exhausting. Risks of accidents are high as a result of a poor mastering of technique or a loss of balance from fatigue.
- The deadlift may seem simple, but it is actually a very technical exercise. for this reason, you may want to avoid using it when you first start weightlifting.
- The deadlift may not be the best way to isolate and therefore specifically strengthen the lower back. Furthermore, it is far riskier for the spine than isolating exercises such as the hyperextension performed on a bench (see the next exercise).
        
**TIPS**:
- To lift dumbbells or a barbell, do not pull with your legs first and then your back. Use them both at the same time.
- Curving your back to grab the weights (e.g., if you have long legs and short arms) puts your back in a bad position. if you can’t reach the weights without curving your back, consider setting them on a bench a bit below knee level to reduce your range of motion.
- Keeping the slight natural arch in your back becomes more difficult as your lumbar muscles tire. At that point, your spine starts to curve. By arching your spine forward, you’ll be able to handle heavier weight or push through a few more repetitions, which is why most women shift from a perfectly aligned back to a forward arch as the set progresses. However, this position places your back in a very hazardous position for the sake of a few more reps; the risk of injury is high. Keep your back aligned even if it means you don’t perform as many reps.

</p>


### HYPEREXTENSIONS:
Hyperextension belongs in the isolating exercise category because only the hip joint is mobilized. nevertheless, the hyperextension does recruit large muscle groups such as the lumbar muscles, the glutes, and the hamstrings. Unlike the deadlift, which tends to compress the intervertebral discs, the hyperextension is safer for the lower back but less effective in terms of overall strengthening. However, if your lower back is fragile, we recommend this isolating exercise over the deadlift.

##### How to Do It: 
- Enter the bench, place your ankles under the padded brace, and bend over. Relax your spine for a second before slowly starting to raise your torso using your lumbar muscles. once you are parallel to the floor (on a classic bench) or perpendicular to the floor (on a 45-degree bench), remain in the contracted position for a second before returning to the starting position and repeating.
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a4/a3/fc/a4a3fc65d1af3dc6faf5fbb9d16eceed.gif">
</p>

**Pro**:
- Hyperextension is a safe way to strengthen the lumbar muscles, because, unlike the deadlift, it places very little tension on the intervertebral discs.

**Cons**: 
- The movement becomes very easy very quickly, which reduces its effectiveness even if you try to overload the movement by holding a weight plate over your head or against your chest.
- To avoid damaging your spine, perform the hyperextension in a slow, controlled manner. The lower back muscles are meant to contract more in an isometric manner rather than explosively. If you feel any pain in your spine on the way up, do not raise your back any higher.

**TIPS**:
- Placing the padded brace low over your quadriceps forces your glutes to provide most of the work, reducing the involvement of your lower back muscles. Placing the brace over your lower abs forces the lumbar muscles to provide most of the effort. as you can see, the hyperextension can become a lumbar or a glute exercise depending on where you place the brace that holds your torso.

**VARIATIONS**:
Two main lower back benches are available.

- **90-degree bench**: As shown earlier, the classic bench places you parallel to the floor. this bench is not very comfortable to get into and use, but it provides more resistance for the lumbar muscles and a stronger stretch for the spine in the bottom position. it is therefore a more advanced bench.

- **45-degree bench**: Because of its inclination, this bench is easy to get into and out of. the resistance imposed by gravity is less than with a 90-degree bench, so it is easier to start with. However, the range of motion as well as the stretch of the spine is less than with a 90-degree bench. the 45-degree bench is a good choice if you are a beginner or cannot stand to have your head upside down.

## Enhance your Chest
**Anatomy and Morphology** 
The pectoralis muscles allow you to move your arms forward when they must overcome a resistance (e.g., when pushing a door). they are also indispensable for keeping your arms together; for example, when holding a baby. In that case, the biceps are doing most of the work, but the chest muscles ensure that your arms remain close together. Without them, you would not be able to hold a baby very long.
The pectoralis major contains three heads:

     (1). The clavicular head, also known as the upper chest;
   
     (2). The sternocostal head, which is the central part of the chest;
     
     (3). The abdominal head, which is the lower chest;

</p>
  
### Take-Home Lesson for Women
In women, only the upper part of the chest is visible because of the presence of the breasts (which are mammary glands covered with fat, not muscle). For this reason, we concentrate on this area. however, this does not mean that the lower part of the chest will be neglected. When you concentrate primarily on the upper chest, the inferior part receives more than enough indirect stimulation. Unfortunately, contrary to popular belief, working the chest muscles does not prevent the breasts from sagging or make them any bigger.
The breasts are natural fat storage areas in women:

</p>

### Chest exercises:
There are three main categories of exercises for the pectoralis muscles from which women can benefit:

       (1). Press
       
       (2). Fly
       
       (3). Pullover
       
Each category has several versions, which guarantees a great variety of movements and allows you to choose the ones that best suit both your anatomy and your goals.

### 1. PRESS
The chest press belongs in the basic, multiple-joint exercise category because both the shoulder and the elbow joints are mobilized. As result, the press recruits many muscle groups in addition to the chest: the front area of the shoulders, the triceps, and the upper part of the back. the press is considered a good starting exercise because it stimulates so many muscles of the upper body. Because of this diversity of muscle recruitment, people can handle a significant amount of weight.

##### How to Do It: 
- Lie with your back on a bench or the seat of a machine. Grab the barbell, dumbbells, or handles. If you are using dumbbells, bring them to your shoulders with a pronated grip (thumbs toward each other). straighten your arms using your chest muscles. Dumbbells should touch at the height of the movement. Then, lower the weight by bending your arms.

<p align="center">
  <img src="http://roicandbru.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/MASTER-ROTATING-CHEST-copy.gif">
</p>

**Pro** - Because it stimulates a large amount of muscle mass in a very short time, the press can be the cornerstone of your upper-body training.

**Con**: 
- It is easy to lose control of the load, especially with free weights. You are likely to get hurt if the weight falls on you. If possible, start by using machines instead of free weights until you master the proper pressing techniques. After a few weeks of machine training, you can switch to free weights if you so desire.

##### VARIATIONS:
       (1). Barbell Press
       
       (2). Dumbell Press
       
       (3). Smith Machine Press
       
       (4). Machine Press
       
###### 1. Barbell Press
**Pro**:
- You can bench press in every gym or even at home with a simple barbell and a bench. however, despite the ready availability of the equipment, using a barbell has more drawbacks than advantages.

**Cons**:
- Balancing a long barbell is not easy and might even prove dangerous for beginners.
- Unracking the barbell and replacing it are hazardous for the joints; these movements offer no muscle-strengthening effects.
- The barbell may fall on you at the end of a set when your muscle strength suddenly diminishes.
- You can bench press in every gym or even at home with a simple barbell and a bench. however, despite the ready availability of the equipment, using a barbell has more drawbacks than advantages.

###### 2. Dumbell Press
**Pros**:
- The degree of contraction is far greater with dumbbells than with a barbell because in the contracted position your hands end up closer together.
- You can adopt any hand and elbow position. This freedom is much more restricted with a barbell.

**Con**:
- Balancing dumbbells is not easy and might even prove dangerous if you let one go during the last repetition of a set as your strength lessens. most common with beginners.


###### 3. Smith Machine Press
**Pros**:
- A Smith Machine can be a good compromise between a barbell and a machine, yet safer than free weights for a beginner. The advantage of a smith machine is that you do not have to balance the weight, which reduces the need for a partner.
- Safety pins are available on every good smith machine. In the case of a sudden loss of strength, the bar will crash on them rather than on you, therefore, do not forget to put them on!

**Con**:
- The movement involves a potentially dangerous (for some women’s morphology), unnatural linear trajectory rather than a slightly circular arc, as it does with free weights and with most good machines.

###### 4. Machine Press
**Pros**:
- If you are a beginner, you may have difficulty pressing while lying on a bench. It may even feel very unnatural to be forced to mobilize all your strength in that position. In that case, machines that allow you to press while seated may be better suited for you.
- Machines are very stable and do not require you to balance the weight.
- No manipulation of the barbell or dumbbells is required. everything is already in place. You need only press, concentrating strictly on your chest muscles.
- Overall, good machines are much safer and easier to use than free weights, especially if you are new to fitness.

**Con**:
- There are more poorly designed machines than there are good ones. As a beginner, it is hard to know which ones are good and which ones are bad. As a rule of thumb, with the best machines, you bring your hands closer together as you press the weight; as you bring the weight down, your hands get farther apart. A good machine duplicates the range of motion of dumbbells without the constraint of having to balance the load. 

**Variations in Bench angle** - The three main variations of the press are performed as follows:
- On a flat bench, to recruit the whole chest muscle;
- On an incline bench, to favor the recruitment of the upper part of the chest;
- On a decline bench, to better target the lower chest;

Machines also offer these variations, although because you are seated, they may not be apparent. How you are pushing on the machine indicates the variation as follows:
- Pushing up duplicates the motion of an incline bench;
- Pushing out in front of you targets the whole chest just as a flat bench does;
- Pushing down mimics the motion on a decline bench.


> NOTE:
> For women, using an **incline bench** or a **machine that duplicates** it is most appropriate because this version recruits more of
the upper part of the chest as well as the front shoulders. It is far more useful for women to work the visible part of the chest. 
Therefore, the incline press is most effective and saves time as well. Note that because the effort is more localized in the upper  
chest area rather than in the overall pectoral, you cannot handle as heavy a weight with the incline press as you can with a flat or decline press. The declined position is useful only for men who want to accentuate the separation of the chest from the upper abs. 
It has no utility for women.

**TIPS**:
- Arching your lower back reduces the range of motion, allowing you to handle heavier weights. however, it makes you more prone to back
injuries and transfers the muscular tension from the upper to the lower part of the chest, rendering the exercise less productive. Arching the back might be a good strategy for men, but not for women..
- So not move your head from side to side or up and down while pressing. Keep it safely on the bench to avoid any shaking movement of the neck.
- The bench press is like a reverse push-up. Instead of moving your body, you move only your arms. If you do not have access to weightlifting equipment, push-ups are a good alternative.

### 2. FLY
The press recruits many muscle groups in addition to the chest: the front area of the shoulders, the triceps, and the upper part of the back. the press is considered a good starting exercise because it stimulates so many muscles of the upper body. Because of this diversity of muscle recruitment, people can handle a significant amount of weight.

##### How to Do It: 
- Grab two dumbbells, sit on the edge of the bench, and bring the dumbbells to your shoulders using a neutral hand grip (thumbs pointing up) as you lower your back onto the bench. Straighten your arms in front of you as if you were doing a bench press.
Once in position, lower your arms to your sides while keeping them semistraight. When your hands are at about the same level as your chest, bring the dumbbells together using your chest muscles. then, lower the weights again by moving the dumbbells apart without bending your arms too much.

<p align="center">
  <img src="http://roicandbru.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/MASTER-ROTATING-CHEST-copy.gif">
</p>

**Pro** - Because it stimulates a large amount of muscle mass in a very short time, the press can be the cornerstone of your upper-body training.

**Con**: 
- It is easy to lose control of the load, especially with free weights. You are likely to get hurt if the weight falls on you. If possible, start by using machines instead of free weights until you master the proper pressing techniques. After a few weeks of machine training, you can switch to free weights if you so desire.

##### How to Do It - Dumbells: 
- Lie with your back on a bench or the seat of a machine. Grab the barbell, dumbbells, or handles. If you are using dumbbells, bring them to your shoulders with a pronated grip (thumbs toward each other). straighten your arms using your chest muscles. Dumbbells should touch at the height of the movement. Then, lower the weight by bending your arms.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://www.cyanartstudios.com/upload/2019/01/08/dumbbell-bench-flyes-28-images-134-best-images-about-flat-bench-dumbbell-fly-l-09ef023b76906c28.gif">
</p>

The dumbbells do not have to touch at the top of the movement. In fact, there is little resistance at the height of the exercise. If you cannot feel your chest muscles when your arms are up, it is better to work under continuous tension. To avoid losing the contraction in your chest muscle, stop the dumbbells at three quarters of the movement rather than perform it completely. With dumbbells, you can rotate your wrists to feel the pectoralis muscles contracting more. 

##### How to Do It - Machine Fly: 
Sit in the machine and grab one pad or handle, and then the other. Bring the two pads or handles together until they touch. remain in this contracted position for one second and bring your arms back. Unlike with dumbbells, make sure you bring your hands as close as possible to really squeeze the chest muscles. Do not overstretch your chest in the starting position.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/32/9a/cb/329acb7b9bd72c0a657dc022cc52df8b.gif">
</p>

##### How to Do It - Cable Crossover: 
Grab one handle and then the other with your arms parallel to the floor, forming a t with your body. Then bring your arms in toward your body. Remain in this contracted position for one second and bring your arms back up (you can also cross your arms as shown to increase the range of motion). The main advantage of the cable over dumbbells or a machine is that you can bring your arms either toward your abdomen or toward your head (or anywhere else between these two points) to change the angle at which the pectoralis
muscles work. In fact, the chest area should be worked at a variety of angles. The lower you bring your arms down, the more you’ll target your lower chest. A higher arm position at the shoulder or head level stimulates the upper portion of the chest more. as noted earlier, from an aesthetic standpoint, women typically don’t need to train the lower part of the chest intensely; the upper chest is more important.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/78/04/ef/7804efe5c2d98d50939d01c823be2157.gif">
</p>

**Pros**:
- The chest fly provides a good stretch for the pectoralis muscles.
- Unlike with the bench press, the triceps muscles are not involved, which means they will not tire before the pectoralis muscles do.

**Cons**: 
- It can be difficult to focus the contraction on the pectoralis muscles only and not on the shoulders.
- Because almost no resistance exists at the top of the movement, it can be difficult to feel the pectoralis muscles contract when using dumbbells.
- Never straighten your arms completely during the exercise because doing so places too much unwanted stress on the biceps tendons.

**TIPS**: 
- To really stimulate your chest muscles, you must do this exercise slowly and with continuous tension. Avoid any jerking of the weights.
- If you have trouble feeling your pectoralis muscles during multiple-joint exercises such as the press, you can learn to feel their contractions using the fly. After a few weeks of training with this isolating movement, you will have better sensations during the basic pectoralis exercises.
- With dumbbells or with the cable crossover, the exercise is much easier if you bend your arms; this is why you should make an effort not to bend your arms more and more as the set goes on. When you reach failure, you can always bend your arms a little so that you can perform a few more repetitions. The same problem occurs on machines, which have you perform the fly with your arms in a semistraight position.

### 3. PULLOVER
The pullover should not be considered a muscle-building exercise for the chest. Rather, use it to stretch your shoulders and rib cage to improve your posture.

##### How to Do It: 
- Grab a dumbbell, holding it with both hands in a neutral grip (thumbs toward your head). Lie on your back either completely on the bench or across the bench. Your head should be just on the edge of the bench so that your arms can hang freely over it. This will provide a greater range of motion and a better stretch. If you are lying across the bench, your shoulders should be just on the edge of the bench to avoid any excessive stretch. Once in position, straighten your arms above your head. take a deep breath so that you inflate your rib cage to its maximum, and try to squeeze your shoulder blades together. You should feel your rib cage opening up.
While keeping your arms in a semistraight position, lower the weight behind your head. When your arms are extended from your body,
raise them back up using the strength of your pectoralis muscles while exhaling all the air so that you deflate your rib cage. Stop
the movement when the dumbbell is above your head, and then lower it again.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://www.rd.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/14-dumbbell-pullover-the-best-14-upper-body-exercises-dumbbells.gif">
</p>

**Pros**:
- The pullover stretches the pectoralis muscles and shoulders simultaneously (two groups that tend to naturally lack flexibility).
- It helps increase endurance because of the respiratory muscle work it provides.

**Cons**: 
- The pullover places the shoulder joints in a relatively unstable position. For this reason, avoid using a weight that’s too heavy. Increase the number of repetitions rather than the weight. 

**TIPS**: 
- You can bend your arms very slightly to increase the stretch, but if you bend them too much, the work will transfer to the back muscles, robbing the effort from the pectoralis muscles.
- Don’t bring the dumbbell all the way back down to your abdomen; stop it when it is above your head. With free weights, the more you bring your arms up, the less resistance you place on your muscles. therefore, it is best to use a limited range of motion by not raising your arms too high past your head.


## Firm Up Your arms
The arm is divided into three muscle groups:

       (1). Biceps
       
       (2). Triceps
       
       (3). Forearms
 
## 1. BICEPS
**Anatomy and Morphology** 
- The role of the biceps is to flex the forearm and lift it toward the upper arm. The biceps itself has two heads (parts of the muscle):
      
       (1). The long head (the one on the exterior), which is the most visible;
       
       (2). The short head (the internal part of the biceps), which is somewhat hidden by the torso because it is close to the body;

  <p align="center">
    <img src="https://anatomyinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/arm-muscles.jpg">
  </p>

Aside from the biceps, the forearm flexor muscles have two other lesserknown muscles:     

      (1). The brachialis muscle, which is located underneath the biceps and functions somewhat like a second biceps;
       
      (2). The brachioradialis muscle, which is on the forearm but is somewhat fused with the biceps;
       
### Take-Home Lesson for Women
Having strong arms is useful in everyday life. However, the goal for most women is not to develop huge biceps, but to tone them. Therefore, do not spend too much time on the following biceps exercises, especially given that the biceps are already strongly involved in all the basic exercises for the back.

### Biceps Exercises: 
Curls are the main category of exercise for the biceps. Many types of curls exist, but the lifting technique is the same for all of them. The only difference is the degree of involvement of the forearm flexors depending on your wrist and elbow positions. However, curls can be performed in very different ways depending on how you hold the weight and how your elbow is positioned (in front of you, beside your torso, or behind it). Each version targets the forearm flexor muscles in a unique way.  The curl does not recruit much of the muscle groups surrounding the biceps and the forearms. Following are the five curl variations addressed in this section:

       (1). Supinated curl
       
       (2). Hammer curl
       
       (3). Reverse curl
              
       (4). Curl with the elbows elevated
       
       (5). Curl with the elbows behind the body

### Three Hand Positions for the Curl: 
The curl is the main exercise for training the forearm flexor muscles. The three hand positions used with the curl, however, affect the arm muscles very differently.

  <p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/hands-position.png">
  </p>

**Pro**:
- With dumbbell curls, your arms are free to use the most natural path possible for your anatomy;

**Cons**: 
- Because the temptation to cheat is stronger in this exercise than any other, many people do not really work the biceps.

**TIPS**:
- Do not perform several forms of curls during the same workout. If you like variety, alternate by doing classic supinated curls during one workout and a different form of curl in the next workout.

## 1. Supinated CURL
##### How to Do It: 
- Grasp a dumbbell in each hand using a supinated hand position. Use your biceps to bend your arm. Bring the weight as high as possible and hold at the top, contracted position for one second while squeezing your forearm tightly against your biceps. Lower the weight slowly back to your start position. Repeat with the other arm. Another option is to lift both dumbbells at once.

Lifting both arms simultaneously saves you time and forces you to work on your balance. On the other hand, alternating arms allows you to lift slightly more weight or do more repetitions with the same weight because one arm is provided extra rest time while you flex the other.

  </p>
  
## 2. Hammer Curl
##### How to Do It: 
- Hold two dumbbells in a neutral position (thumbs up) during the whole set. As opposed to supinated curls, this isolation exercise targets the brachialis and brachioradialis muscles and does not stimulate the biceps as much. We show here hammer curls with dumbbells, a low pulley, and weight plates. All three versions are very similar as far as their muscle focus; try them all to discover which one is the most comfortable and works the best for you.

Your arm is stronger when you use a neutral, rather than a supinated, hand position. For this reason, you can use heavier weights with hammer curls than with classic supinated curls. Just be careful that the weight doesn’t result in a reduced range of motion.

  </p>
  
## 3. Reverse Curl
##### How to Do It: 
- Hold two dumbbells or a bar using a pronated hand position (palms down with the thumbs facing each other) during the whole set. This isolation exercise specifically targets the brachioradialis, the brachialis, and a little bit of the biceps.

If you feel that a straight bar places too much stress on your wrists, try using an EZ bar instead. If you still feel an unnatural twist of your forearms, dumbbells are the solution. In that case, instead of having both thumbs facing each other, bring them up slightly so that you minimize the rotation of your hands.

  </p>

## 4. Curl with the Elbows Elevated
##### How to Do It: 
- When your elbow is elevated, the brachialis muscle works a bit more and the biceps a bit less than with classic (supinated) curls. This particularly emphasizes the interior of the biceps. Straightening the arms completely is even more dangerous with the elbows elevated than with regular curls. Shortening your range of motion will minimize the risk of tearing your biceps tendons.

If you feel that a straight bar places too much stress on your wrists, try using an EZ bar instead. If you still feel an unnatural twist of your forearms, dumbbells are the solution. In that case, instead of having both thumbs facing each other, bring them up slightly so that you minimize the rotation of your hands.

  </p>
  
 ## 5. Curl With the Elbows Behind the Body
 ##### How to Do It: 
- Whenever you place your elbow behind your body (as during curls performed on an incline bench), you better isolate the exterior of the biceps. The interior head and the brachialis receive less stimulation.

If you feel an overwhelming stretch at the shoulder level, it means your arms are too far behind your body, a position that could damage the long head of the biceps tendon. This risk comes from using too flat of a bench; adjust it up closer to the 90° position instead.

## TRICEPS

**Anatomy and Morphology** 
The triceps has three heads. The lateral head (on the exterior) is the most visible. The other two heads are somewhat hidden by the torso. Therefore, you should focus on developing the lateral head so you can quickly see the results of your training. The triceps is the antagonistic muscle to the biceps and the brachialis. It extends the arm. The long head of the triceps is the only one of the three heads of the triceps that is a multiple-joint muscle. It does more than just extend the arm as the other two heads do; it also helps bring the arm toward the body or to the rear, in conjunction with the back and rear shoulder muscles. As such, it is involved in all back and rear shoulder exercises. For this reason, to avoid the all-too-common elbow injuries, carefully warm up your elbows before working your back.

### Take-Home Lesson for Women
As with the biceps, most women do not strive to develop huge triceps. Simply toning them a little is a common goal. The main difference between biceps and triceps is that the back of the arm is an important storage area for fat in women. By training your triceps frequently with lighter weight and high repetitions, you can prevent this deposit of fat. Triceps training is important not only for immediate results but also for the future: After menopause, many women lose the fat covering the triceps as a result of hormonal disruptions. This shift can leave an excess of skin hanging from your arms. Once this sagging skin is in place, there is not much you can do to get rid of it except through surgery. This is why it is important to prevent the accumulation of fat on your triceps early in life.

#### TRICEPS EXERCISES

       (1). Cable push-down
       
       (2). Triceps extension
       
       (3). Triceps kickback
              
       (4). Narrow grip press   
       
### ATENTION - Protect Your Elbow Joints:
The elbow joint is very fragile. This is why we recommend avoiding using heavy weights for the direct triceps exercises. High repetitions with lighter weights are safer for the elbows. This strategy is also more in tune with your primary goal of keeping fat off your triceps. The elbow joint is especially fragile in women as a result of their much greater range of forearm motion than men. Women’s much more pronounced recurvatum at the elbow allows them to bring their forearms farther back than men can. This enhances the contraction of the triceps, but it also places the elbow joint in a very vulnerable position. If you are using heavy weights in
any triceps exercises or in the chest or shoulder presses, do not straighten your arms completely to avoid placing your elbow joints in this precarious position.

## 1. Cable push-down
- The push-down does not recruit many muscles except the triceps and the forearm flexors.
##### How to Do It: 
Attach a short triceps bar, straight bar, or rope to the upper part of a pulley machine. You can grab the rope with your hands in a neutral position (thumbs pointing up), the triceps bar in a semineutral or pronated position (thumbs facing each other), and the straight bar in a pronated position. use whichever grip allows you to contract your triceps the most. Push on the bar or rope so that you bring your hands to your thighs while keeping your elbows close to your sides. Hold the contracted position for one second before returning to the starting position without moving your elbows. You can stand with your feet together, or staggered; the staggered stance shown here is more challenging to your balance.

  <p align="center">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmazingBooks/Women-s-Strength-Training-Anatomy/master/images/pull-down.png">
  </p>
  
**Pro**:
- Working the triceps with a pulley is less traumatic for the elbow joints than using your body weight (as in doing push-ups), dumbbells, a barbell, or any other kind of machines. A more complex pulley network reduces the forces and thus is gentler for the joints.;

**Con**: 
- Because the triceps is not used on a daily basis, many beginners have trouble feeling this muscle working. At first, do this exercise slowly so that you can learn to feel your triceps contracting.

**TIP**:
- Lifting your elbows while the bar is moving up is perceived as a mistake. This is true if you are trying to isolate your triceps. However, to work the triceps and the back in synergy as nature intended, you can lift your elbows to your chin or nose level while the bar is rising. Both your hands and your elbows will be pushed down as you press the bar. Many people in the gym are likely to comment that this technique is a mistake, but this only reveals their lack of anatomy knowledge. Do not let these people influence you.
- While lying, seated, or standing, grab an EZ bar or a dumbbell with both hands (for bilateral work) or a dumbbell with one hand (for unilateral work). Lower the weight to your forehead (if lying) or behind your head (if seated or standing) with your elbows and pinkie fingers pointing toward the ceiling. Using your triceps, straighten your arms before bringing the weight back down. With dumbbells, you can shift from a neutral grip (thumbs facing down) in the stretched position to a pronated grip (thumbs facing each other) in the
contracted position to better squeeze your triceps.

## 2. Triceps extension
##### How to Do It: 
You can use a high or low pulley to work either both arms at the same time or to alternate between arms. Attach a rope that you can grab with one or both hands. To work both arms at the same time, grab the rope and stand facing away from a high pulley with your feet staggered and your upper body leaning forward at about a 120-degree angle to the floor. Extend your arms straight ahead and then slowly bend them to lower the weight back down. To work one arm at a time, stand perpendicular to a low pulley with your nonworking arm closer to the machine. Grab the rope behind your head with your elbow bent and extend your arm straight up; then slowly bend it to lower the weight back down.

  <p align="center">
    <img src="https://www.sparkpeople.com/assets/exercises/Standing-Overhead-Triceps-Pull-on-Cable-Cross-Machine.gif">
  </p>
  
**Pro**:
- This exercise is unique in the category of triceps exercises in that it provides a good stretch;

**Con**: 
- With free weights, as fatigue sets in, it is easy to lose your form, arch your back, or hit yourself in the head with the weight.

**TIPS**:
- The farther your elbows are from your torso, the more you are going to recruit the long head of the triceps.
- Doing this exercise unilaterally creates a better stretch and a more pronounced contraction as a result of a greater range of motion.
- Performing this exercise standing forces you to arch your back, which may cause disc compressions. The seated position is safer. The lying position is the safest as far as back protection is concerned. Lying on a bench or on the floor not only protects your back but also improves your form by preventing you from swinging your torso.

</p>

## 2. Triceps Kickback
The triceps kickback does not recruit many muscles except the triceps and the forearm flexors.

##### How to Do It: 
This exercise can be done unilaterally. While leaning forward, grab a dumbbell with your hand in the neutral position (thumb pointing forward). In the starting position, your upper arm should be close to your side and roughly parallel to the floor. The elbow is bent to about a 90-degree angle with the upper arm. using your triceps, straighten your arm along your side. Hold the position for at least one
second with the arm extended before lowering the weight. The unilateral version places less stress on the lower back and allows you
to perform the movement in a stricter manner with perfect technique. The bilateral version takes less time.

  </p>
  
**Pro**:
- Of all the free-weight triceps exercises, this one is the safest on the elbow. You should be able to perform triceps kickbacks even if your elbows hurt a little when you do other triceps exercises.

**Con**: 
- Little muscle stretch is provided by this exercise, so some women have difficulty feeling the triceps contraction.

**TIPS**:
- Hold the extended position as long as possible to contract your triceps as much as possible. In fact, you have to generate a lot of muscle tension to keep your arms extended during this exercise—unlike with other triceps exercises. 
- You can focus the work on the outside portion of your triceps by turning your pinkie finger slightly to the outside in the contracted position.
- Instead of dumbbells, you can use a low pulley. The main advantage of the pulley is that it provides more continuous and fluid tension than free weights do.

# PART III Programs
### CIRCUIT TRAINING
If you have little time to train or if you wish to tone up your body while getting rid of as much fat as possible, or both, circuits are the most appropriate form of training. Start with one session per week; as you progress, add more training days, performing the same circuit. You will know it is time to add more training days by closely monitoring your muscle strength. At first, if you do not have any athletic background, your muscles will feel tired for days after a workout. As you progress, their recovery will get faster and faster. When you do not need as much rest as before, it is time to add new training sessions.

#### Minimal equipment, Whole Body
Do 1 or 2 circuits per workout without any rest between exercises. You should do 20 to 30 repetitions per set depending on your level of fitness.
